## Building A Better Gareth

This blog is about making me a better person.

If you want to be a better person read along. 

Or help out by commenting. Comments about things you think I'm wrong 
about or areas to look into deeper are especially welcome.

The best comments are about ways you've tackled something similar 
successfully in your own life.

## What Gareth Wants To Improve

In no particular order:

* Health

* Relationships

* Fun

## What Gareth Identifies As

In no particular order:

* Christian

* Male

* Heterosexual & Cis

* Anglo Saxon

* Australian

* Gamer

* Married

* College Education & Employed

Gareth gets to tick all of the good privilege boxes. The closest to a 
minority I get is _gamer_ and even that is entering the mainstream of 
privilege now.
