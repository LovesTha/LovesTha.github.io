With the release of the documentary _The Burial Cave of Jesus_ many local current affairs programs have been proclaiming that the Bedrock of Christianity has been undermined and that this will have profound effects on the Church at large.

Their claims are based on the idea that without a physical resurrection of Christ's body Christianity is a farce. Such claims fail to realize that many Christians believe the resurrection of Christ wasn't a physical but purely spiritual event. I wont fully commit to either camp, but believe that the concepts held up by a spiritual resurrection of Jesus are the most important.

Just because the Pope says something, doesn't mean its true or that its what all Christians believe
