Firstly I like to name decks after obscure song references. This is named after the character in the Dresden Dolls song "Slide", as this is a variation on slide decks adding Solitary Confinement.

I've been looking at CAL and Slide decks for a while and been thinking that some form of mashing them together seams like the right idea. So here is a random Slide list I found on the [SCG forums](http://www.starcitygames.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=275953&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=675):<!-- more -->

Creatures  
3x Birds of Paradise  
3x Sakura-Tribe Elder  
4x Eternal Witness  
4x Loxodon Hierarch  
3x Eternal Dragon  
2x Dwarven Blastminer  

Spells  
3x Shred Memory  
4x Wrath of God  
1x Life from the Loam  
2x Hide//Seek  
4x Gilded Light  
3x Astral Slide  

Lands  
4x Windswept Heath  
2x Forest  
2x Plains  
1x Swamp  
1x Mountain  
2x Temple Garden  
1x Stomping Ground  
1x Sacred Foundry  
1x Godless Shrine  
1x Overgrown Tomb  
4x Tranquil Thicket  
4x Secluded Steppe  

Sideboard  
4x Leyline of the Void  
4x Condemn  
2x Hide//Seek  
3x Cranial Extraction  
2x Dwarven Blastminer

The first thing I want to do is remove the red, I really don't think its needed and I want a more consistent mana base.

Secondly I know I want to remove the graveyard hate, I'm going to rely on my graveyard too much. As I know that extended is very graveyard centric I will add a full compliment of Withered Wretches between the main deck and sideboard.

Lastly I love the tutor engine of this deck, Shred Memory is a useful card in many match ups and is a very powerful tutor, I feel I want to add one or two Dimir House Guards to allow for other relevant tutors as well, tutoring for Hierarch or Wrath is very important at times. Giving the deck more of an opportunity for turn 3 Wrath can be vital.

The issue of a tutor engine is quite difficult though, should I max out on just one of the two searchers or on both? Searching for wrath is important at times, but then sometime finding Cruel Edict is enough. Should I go further and include a single copy of Grim Harvest to give the deck another method of recurring its threats/tutors. I think that's a very good idea, but should it be a singleton or a play set. It seams strange to include singletons of that you want to cast several times but to include a play set of something that just helps the recursion, but I think the deck will rarely be able to afford to waste the tutor on the engine piece.

Anyway, I'll play with the deck a bit more and post about it after the random Extended tournament tomorrow.
