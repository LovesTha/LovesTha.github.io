Now that some of the heat has gone out of the debate I feel it is time to tackle it intelligently. A reality of human nature and biology is that their are going to be unplanned pregnancies. Just as real is that some of these pregnancies will be unwanted.

How as a society do we let people deal with this?

There are three options that present them selves as obvious:



	
  * Suck it up and become a parent.

	
  * Rush off for an abortion.

	
  * Get someone else to raise the child.


At the same time as we have been demonising mothers who give away their children, we have babies being found thrown out in the garbage. Deciding to give away a child is a much better situation, and we should be thankful that some people can think so coolly while in such despair. Why are people in such despair when making these decisions?<!-- more -->

Firstly we don't encourage them to be open about things. The only instance where people are allowed to be open about what they've done is when it is physically impossible to not be, few believe the 17 year old single mother that she choose to be where she is. Preventing people being open about the two other options exerts pressure that needn't be there. Pressure is of it self a bad thing, causing significant mental disorders I am sure. That pressure though probably pushes people towards abortions,Â  even if they don't want them.

I wonder though if more unwanted pregnancies could be used to lessen societies use of IVF, a technology that I don't really like. Not for the usual life is sacred reasons, just that it seems to be a unhealthy method of circumventing some of natural selection. If you can't get pregnant naturally, maybe there is a reason for this, and it isn't in our best interests to get around that.

What I'm asking is, should we encourage pregnant women who don't want to raise a child to carry the baby to term and give it away for adoption. If we do encourage this how do we ensure that the mother does the right thing for the child by not smoking, etc? Offering cash rewards for babies born from healthy mothers will create a market for such children and encourage women to get pregnant just to sell the child.

I have to wonder if such a situation is better or worse than the current though.

The first step though is to get everyone talking openly about things. When a work colleague casually tells me they had a day off work for an abortion, we might be starting to get close to a situation where a good solution might occur.
