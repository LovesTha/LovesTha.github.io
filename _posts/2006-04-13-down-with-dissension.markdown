Oh yeah!

Today's preview card on magicthegathering.com really is quiet the little beastie:

Rakdos Pit Dragon 2RR

Creature - Dragon 

RR: ~ gains flying until end of turn.

R: ~ gets +1/+0 until end of turn.

_Hellbent_ - ~ has double strike as long as you have no cards in hand.

3/3

This dude is obviously such a powerhouse. Its definitely got the ability to define the block season, except that's not a season that actually going to happen. He is going to give such huge headaches to anyone who isn't prepared for him. He ends games very quickly especially in the late game, he only requires 9 red mana to deal 20 damage in the air. Mono red decks will get very scary, turn 4 cast him, turn 5 and 6 attack for 10 in the air, without making your 5th land drop. 

The problem is getting your hand empty enough before you cast him and being able to get rid of those cards easily in the late game. There are currently no ways to discard cards in Standard for a positive effect, naturally you'd play him with the Avatar.

Creature - Avatar

Flying

When ~ comes into play, sacrifice it unless you discard two cards.

5/3

Turn 3 avatar followed by turn 4 dragon will be very scary. Even if both dudes do die to Last Gasp, you opponent can only play so many removal spells. I want to know how WotC think that both of those dudes aren't going to be completely nuts in Standard.
