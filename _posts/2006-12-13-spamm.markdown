I've been reading lots about how spamm is on the increase, and my personal experience shows that their has been a significant increase in the last few weeks.

Several months ago I celebrated that my Gmail account had finally more email threads than spamm messages (which are deleted every 30 days). The crossing point was somewhere around 900 spamm/threads.

Currently I have <strike>1955</strike> 1956 spamm and 2116 email threads.

That's 65 spamm every day (averaged over the last month), when will this end?
