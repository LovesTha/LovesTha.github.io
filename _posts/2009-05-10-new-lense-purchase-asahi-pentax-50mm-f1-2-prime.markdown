I've been looking at buying some lenses since I brought my Pentax K20D in November. Straight after buying it I borrowed Dad's old Pentax lenses so I've been carrying around:

* 18-55mm F3.5-4.5 DA kit lens that came with the camera. This is very handy for those situations where you think a bit of weather proofing would be useful. With the crop factor putting the range to 27-82mm it is a very useful range of zoom as well.<!-- more -->

* 18-80mm F3.5-4.5 Macro lens of Dad's, only useful because of the macro function and the slightly longer zoom range, 120mm after crop factor is a reasonably long lens.

* 100-300mm F? Telephoto lens of Dad's. This lens is really pushing my ability to hand hold a lens even in good light with the shake reduction turned on. An effect length of 450mm is much longer than I think I really need regularly, it has been good for taking photos of butterflies though.

* 50mm F1.4 DA lens of my house mate. I borrow this lens frequently when I think I will want the extra speed. Several of my favourite photos have been taken with this lens.

So I've been looking to see what options there are for fast 50mm lenses. Recently the F1.4 DA lens increased to around $600 new in Australia. This has made the price of a second hand F1.2 on eBay much more palatable, so this morning I managed to snip one for the (relatively) low price of $AUD450 delivered from the US. It was a nice surprise to find that my snip which was for 20 or 30 USD below the price that several have sold for was not only good enough but ~100 USD above the price I won it for.

I do love eBay.

Why would you pay more?
