Saturday was the second Two Headed Giant of mine to actually run as a sanctioned event. Unusually the teams managed to place in such a way that tie breakers weren't used for standings at all (1 team at the following records: 3-0, 2-1, 1-2, 0-3). At the end of it all The Crowd Favourites (Mohamed and Leon)Â  walked away with it all.
