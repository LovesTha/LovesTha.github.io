I've been trying to wrestle with the question of how I'm going to create my faith community around Magic.  This has been missing the point somewhat though: What am I going to create?  For that matter am I going to create anything or just shape something?

I've been tasked with creating a missional team based around Magic. Kewl, I'll just go do that as soon as I know what a missional team is. (Have a glance at the [NCCC website](http://nccc.org.au) or at [Signposts: Phil and Dans blog](http://www.signposts.org.au) for some references on the church I'm apart of)
Careworks is probably the biggest missional team at Northern, that's a group of people who help out underprivileged and marginalised people in our wider community in practical ways (op shop, food bank, English conversation classes) and interact socially while doing it (a lot of the people working within Careworks are also its target market). So from that example I should gather a group of people who enjoy magic and start running lots of tournaments and events.
Their is two primary fruits of the Careworks at Northern though, the good works that it does in the community AND the connect congregation that meets for lunch on a Thursday. I don't see the value of just running lots of Magic events as the Melbourne Magic community is quite healthy already. There is a need for connecting with it from a Christian perspective though.

So should I try and create a congregation through the tried and true practice of starting with mission projects or by the much more post modern method of inhabiting the community and letting church happen?
