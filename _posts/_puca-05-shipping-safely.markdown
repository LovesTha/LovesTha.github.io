Don't let your cards get damaged, damaging both your wallet and reputation. To 
ensure that your cards arrive in [near mint condition][104], as required to
[receive full Puca Points][102] it is imperitive that they are shipped safely 
and securely. Regularly I receive cards that were a sloppy mailman or rainy day
away from slipping from near mint all the way down to heavily played. 



This wraps up my initial series on [Puca Trade][1], please leave a comment if 
you have any requests for other area's of [Puca Trade][1] that you'd like me to
