So I'm going to be flying to Texas in October for PT:Austin. This will be my first US trip, but I will be going back to the US next year with friends and doing other interesting bits of the US so I'm going to focus on just Texas this time.

All I currently have on my list of things to see is "NASA stuff" so I need some help from the interwebs, hence the Request For Comment. (Not that RFC was intended to refer to the comments field of a blog, it does appear appropriate)
