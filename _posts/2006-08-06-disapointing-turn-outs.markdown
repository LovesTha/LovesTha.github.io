Had just 3 teams worth of players turn up yesterday for the tournament :( Some people still wanted to play some limited so we played a 5 player draft, which was a lot of fun, but is never good as it really is too few players and you get very weird pairings and final standings.

In about 5 minutes I'll post the next move in trying to generate some better attendance at next Two Headed Giant.
