Building Gruul themed decks is easy, take this list that i'm making up on the spot:

20x Creatures
4x Llanowar Elves
4x Wild Cantor
4x Scab-Clan Mauler
4x Giant Solifuge
4x Dryad Sophisticate

4x Enchantments
4x Moldervine Cloak

4x Artifacts
4x Umezama's Jitte

12x Spells
4x Pyroclasm
4x Savage Twister
4x Lightning Helix

20x Land
4x Stomping Ground
4x Sacred Foundry
4x Temple Garden
2x Vitu-Ghazi, the City-Tree
4x Forest
2x Mountain

And your done, I'd like to find the room to put the Burning Tree Shaman in and probably replace the Cantors with Birds, but I'm thinking the deck doesn't really need any mana accelerators at all.
