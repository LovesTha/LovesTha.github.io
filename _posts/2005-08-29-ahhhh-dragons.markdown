What do people like more than dragons?




Dragons on turn 5 - with no mana acceleration




Dragons on turn 3 - with a single seething song




6/6 Dragons,  with haste!




What people don't like though is giving their opponents creatures:




**Hunted Dragon ** 3RR  

Creature - Dragon (R)  

Flying, haste  

When Hunted Dragon comes into play, put three 2/2 white Knight creature tokens with first strike into play under target opponent's control.  

6/6




Mmmm that's what I'm talking about, naturally it sits nicely next to Pyroclasm :)
