Ok, its official, my boycott of unofficial spoilers has ended (although I don't believe [MTGSalvation](http://mtgsalvation.com) has received an unofficial preview yet, but they have posted card from sources without context). This card makes me hope that WotC wont be printing this future mechanic for many many years. It would be rather over powered if in extended at the same time as Dredge.

Creature-Demon Rare
Flying
Delve (You may remove any number of cards in your graveyard from the game as you play this spell. It costs ![1](http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/images/smilies/mana1.gif) less to play for each card removed this way.)
5/5

I wont insult peoples intelligences by attempting to put this into a deck, just know that this will be ridiculous in many formats.
