So I've started up what is intended to be a recurring event in the Pye social 
calendar: Baddass Burgers & Board Games. The inaugural event was Friday night,
We had a great group of friends turn up and other than some leaving early with
medical complaints, I swear they were not caused by the burgers, everyone had
and awesome time.

Part of the impetus for starting up this group was to give me an excuss for 
making some truly badass burgers. I'm not sure that the first event lived up
to the title of *badass*, but the burger was definitely really good. 

For date night a couple of weeks ago Lierin made me a Taco Burger, according to
the printed recipe I found lying around I believe she used the recipe from 
[Taste and Tell][1], it is imaginatively named: [*Taco Burgers*][2]. The basic
idea is a burger patty with taco seasoning and crushed cornchips in the patties.

I'm not sure if the intention was for the corn chips to be basic plain ones, but
we used some tasty ones from our friendly Aldi store. They aren't the best for 
eating later, the corn chips get stale/soggy in the fridge, although they are 
still really tasty.

The two *sauces* on this burger are masterful. Although I must mention that we
substituted the sour cream with natural yogurt, the two sauces were a great 
compliment and contrast. A very well rounded burger.

The only thing I'll be marking my self down on was that the patties I made were
too thick, thick enough that eating the burger was awkward and that one guest
couldn't finish their burger. That guests husband was very very happy to finish
hers though.
