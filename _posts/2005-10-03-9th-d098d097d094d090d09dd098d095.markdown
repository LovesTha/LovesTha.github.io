I was looking into purchasing some 9th edition cases, but in Russian because it sounded like fun and I'd love black bordered pain lands, WOG's, Llanowar Elves, Jester's Caps, Hypnotic Specters, Verdant Forces, etc, etc, etc. To my absolute horror I found that boxes of 9th edition boosters are selling for between $USD150 and $USD220 on eBay and for numbers at the higher end of this scale on web sites. The same websites that are selling normal 9th boxes for $USD69.

I wish WotC would just sell Russian boxes (and all other languages) everywhere for the same price, sure have a larger lead time foreign product (like only stock the product in the countries its spoken in, all others you'll have to wait for WotC's next international shipment) but please sell it. The current environment where WotC frown on people selling boxes from the wrong country is annoying as it means the only people doing it are slightly shady. Buying 'contra-band' from shady people always carries with it an element of risk and a premium price tag.

Hopefully the current pricing is an abnormality due to not enough companies having partnerships with Russian companies to get the product from and that in the near future (2~3 months) prices will become more reasonable (If I can buy a 9th Ed Russian box for the same cost as a locally delivered one I'll buy 2 or 3 cases I think).
