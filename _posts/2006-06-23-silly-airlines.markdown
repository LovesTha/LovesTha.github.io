You know how I'm this lucky guy that can manage to get flown to Canberra for Nationals as apart of my job. Well I just received details of my flights, I'll be flying to the Goldcoast on Wednesday morning for the GPS conference, then flying to Canberra on Thursday, via Melbourne!!!

That's going to be a lot of flying for this little ground hog (last year was the first time I'd flown anywhere twice in 1 year, and only my 3rd and 4th return flights ever) with the return flight to Melbourne on Monday morning.

I guess this serves me right for being such a luck sack.
