So I've been living out of home for 8 weeks now. Yesterday I received my first pyramid scheme chain letter. I presume that who ever sent it must have just searched on the online white pages to find some random addresses and names to send it to.

I guess what makes me the most sad and angry about this type of letter is the two type of people you participate in them. First we have the the people that are too stupid to work out exactly what is going on here. These weak people get greedy, see the promise of lots of money and will do anything. It might have a better chance of making money than a lottery ticket, but that isn't saying much.

The second group are the predators the ones who set up these scheme to make money. They know they will make money because tehre are enough category 1 people. It doesn't take much of a percentage of the population to make it a profitable scheme. The much of the problem is that those who can't afford to waste money are the ones who are going to waste it. These people are the scum of the earth.

The saddest is that many of the people in the first group believe they are in the second. They also don't realise that participating in these schemes is illegal, weather they would count as victims or criminals would be a judgement call.
