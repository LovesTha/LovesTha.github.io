Kevin Andrews has been quoted at using the term "potential asylum seekers" to refer to people who are arriving in Australia. I have a large issue with that, its implying that the important definition of an asylum seeker is the submission of relevant documents with the Australian government.

I'd like to suggest that there is no middle ground from "persecuted person" and "asylum seeker". The second you leave your home country because you fear for your life, you ARE an asylum seeker. Sure people can question if you are a legitimate asylum seeker, or just hoping to find a different form of immigration, but you're never a potential asylum seeker.

This is one of the worst pieces of political spin I've seen this week :(
