One of my largest pet peeves is when advertisers treat us all as idiots. For instance when is a certain battery manufacturer going to realise that saying "last up to 3 times longer" doesn't match the advert they just showed us with the bunny running over 3 times as far as the competing bunny?




Now two of my most visited web sites have just started doing some cross promotion and there using there own images that they generated for the complain wrongly.

[This comic ](http://www.pvponline.com/starcity.php3)depicts two of the main characters doing what they do best (play games) and ends with the cell depicted to the right. What's wrong though is that the advertising for StarCityGames.com shows Brent saying "Owned" at Francis, and then explains that to not get owned you should build your decks with cards you buy from StarCityGames.com. The problem is that Francis brought his deck from SCG and not Brent, so the SCG deck was owned!




Do they think we're stupid enough not to notice, or are they just sloppy enough to not care
