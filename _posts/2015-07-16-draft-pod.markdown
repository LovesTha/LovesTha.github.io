Someone just posted to [#mtgjudge][1] an amazing simple way to run a draft pod 
without software. While it could be really handy if you are running one when WER is 
down, it is probably best for how to do it in a pub or other fun location. Firstly 
find a deck of playing cards and pull out the following cards:

![AS 2H 3C 4D 5S 6H 7C 8D](/img/Draft Pod Cards.png)

Shuffle them and hand one to each of the players. The players then sit in a circle in
the order of the numbers (Ace, 2, 3, etc).

Their round one pairing is the player with the same suit as them.

Their second round pairing is the player with the same colour who doesn't have the same
suit and had the same result in round one.

Their final round is against a player with the same record and a differently coloured 
card.

Very simple and easy for players to remember and adjudicate them selves. All they need
to do is hold onto their playing card. Oh never mind, it'll never work. Maybe ask them
to take a photo of their playing cardâ€¦
