This afternoon I wandered down to my local store and brought into the sealed 
league that started today. I paid my $40 and received my choice of non-black
prerelease kits. Green was my choice as I have a deck I'd like to put a Nissa
into.

The pack taunted me with a promo Nissa's Revelation and then the first pack
I opened had another Nissa's Revelation. For the full details of my packs and
what I built open up [my deck on deckbox.org].

I won the first two matches quite easily but in the third I faced a reasonably
aggressive RW deck that managed to steam rolled me. 

Is there anything that people think I should have changed in the build?
