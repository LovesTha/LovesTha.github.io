Some people have their nickers in a twist about the recent scandal of [Ted Haggard](http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/11/05/haggard.allegations/index.html). I'm most interested with how his local church, the community that he supported with significant work I'm sure, is now supporting him.

I have failed to find a single comment that is clearly a statement that they aren't trying to get as much distance between them selves and Ted. This is my greatest complaint with the major churches in the world. Wherever we find these large churches led by charismatic leaders surrounded by leadership teams that are very enthusiastic we continually get messages from the people who've been spat out by them.

When someone like Ted falls off the bandwagon everyone seams to want to demonise them. People in their own church want to blame them for everything wrong with the church and blame their personal failings on the person. Everyone outside the church wants to use their failure as an example of how that church is evil and wrong (and probably in that order).

What the person needs is for the church to continue to give them what they have been getting from the church up to that point.Â  So someone that has been giving most of their time to the church needs to be able to still give of their time. Sure getting someone who is confused and struggling with issues that they can't talk about in public about it may not be the best choice for giving the sermon on Sunday morning, but there should be other ways he can help out around the building. Also they need to be allowed to participate in worship and learning along with being included in some peer interaction.

If you can't help one of your own through such a time as this, how can you hope to help a stranger through it?
