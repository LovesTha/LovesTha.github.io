I'm actually agreeing with a statement the PM has given. His comments around the increase in funding for school chaplains makes sense and I agree with. [Linkage](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/06/27/1963257.htm)

Naturally this is because he doesn't mention the aspects I disagree with. Like that I believe there are problems for non Christian chaplains and such. But don't that let good news go bad.
