This coming weekend is the Two Headed Giant tournament at my Church, so far we have 8 teams playing and have room left for 2 more teams if people are still interested. (email me at gareth@cerberos.id.au or phone Nigel at 9484 4788 to register or roll the dice and just turn up).

I'm looking forward to running the event and it is looking to be great fun.
