Lets put it like this, the only way my sneak peek experience could have been better is if it was a PTQ.

Every card I opened was damn near perfect. The tournament pack rares were: [Vulturous Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/gathererlookup.asp?set=RavnicaCityofGuilds&name=vulturous_zombie), [Woodraith Corrupter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/gathererlookup.asp?set=RavnicaCityofGuilds&name=woodwraith_corrupter) and [Bottled Cloister](http://gatherer.wizards.com/gathererlookup.asp?name=Bottled_cloister). Dissension gave me such pleasantries as: [Cytoplast Manipulator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/gathererlookup.asp?name=Cytoplast_manipulator), [Avatar of Discord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/gathererlookup.asp?name=Avatar_of_discord) and (you can't have absolutely everything) [Wit's End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/gathererlookup.asp?name=Wit[s_end).  Full list follows

2x Island  

5x Forest  

5x Swamp




I've counted the [Sky Hussar](gatherer.wizards.com/gathererlookup.asp?name=Sky_hussar) as a spell as I wasn't included it as a creature as I had no reasonable chance of casting it in a reasonable time frame but it would easily be used to draw cards as I had 10 blue creatures.




The tournament went as well as could possibly be hoped for. I won each round with only 1 game ever looking like it could possibly go against me. This was against Bruce in the 2nd round. I was up 1-0 in games and the second game was taking quiet a while with the board static with Bruce at 21 life having a single Stinkweed Imp on the table and me at 9 life with 2 dudes on the table, the graft untargetable and some other semi vanilla dude. If Bruce had of not attacked with the Stinkie for several turns, I wouldn't have gotten in enough damage to pull him down to a low 6. I finally managed to kill Bruce on the 5th turn after time, but the games really shouldn't have taken that long.




The other 3 rounds were all over in around 20 minutes.




Total.




I have never spent so much time wandering around trash talking everyone, I may have even trash talked some of the people on the PC's that I could beat them in WoW with my deck. Or maybe that's one of the things I can claim because I'm a hot shot internet author.
