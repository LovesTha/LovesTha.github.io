Some of you may realize that I am a word class procrastinator. My current favorite method of wasting a few seconds every hour at work is 'playing' [_Defend Your Castle_](http://xgenstudios.com/play/castle). Its a marginally fun game with endless game play.

Currently I am on level 175. After roughly level 20, the game nearly plays it self. No interaction is required nearly all of the time.

I'm not sure why I'm recommending it as it really is silly and pointless.

Go waste some time.
