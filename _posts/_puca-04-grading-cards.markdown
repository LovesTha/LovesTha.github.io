This installment of the [Puca Trade series][5] covers the details of grading 
cards for [Puca Trade][1]. I'm going to point you to the best resources I've 
found for describing what a near mint (NM) card is and isn't. Then I'm going 
to discuss how to deal with cards that aren't near mint.

# Pages describing card conditions

## [ABU Games - Detailed Magic the Gathering Cards Condition Guide][10]

ABU Games has the most extensive guide to card conditions. For each condition
they have three or more cards with both front and back images acompanied by a
detailed description of why the card has gained the condition listed.

This is the best resource I've found for learning how to grade cards.

## [Star City Games - Card Conditions][6]

Star City Games provides a useful page that has images describing features of 
cards at each grading level. Their photos give plenty of detail showing the 
issues. They are the best reference to help a home trader learn the different
card conditions.

## [Black Border - Card Conditions][9]

Black Border have used the same card for all their card conditions, making it
easy to see the difference. They have only one example for each level and their
description isn't detailed enough to help a home trader learn what should be 
called what.

### [TCG Player - Magic the Gathering: Card Condition Guide][7]

TCG Player give less examples of things that cause a card to be slightly played
(SP). There photos are of a high quality.

### [Card Kingdom - Grading Guide][8]

Card Kingdom use a different scale to other stores. There second best grade is
EX, which correspondsly with other sources definition of slightly played. Using
different names doesn't change what they are calling less than NM though. They
only have photos of the back of cards and just a single one for each condition.

# Puca Trade Policies

[Puca Trade][1] are very strict on their card conditions. The policy forbids 
sending a card that is less than near mint. Netherless many people are happy to
receive cards that are slightly played. 

Firstly check their profile page to see if they have clarified their position on
cards that are not near mint. Many publicly state that they are never willing to 
receive cards that are not near mint. With those receivers you must quickly 
cancel the trade and there will be little consequence. If you ignore this and 
send any way it is likely that you'll be paying for shipping back to you or 
negotiating a new value with no bargaining power.

If they clearly state that they are happy to receive any card that is slightly played
