10k is always a significant milestone for me. I still have my Winamp play list from when it first hit 10,000.

Unfortunately I missed it when 2 weeks ago this very blog passed its 10,000th page view. This makes it by far my most visited site ever.

So thank you all for viewing. I hope I don't know at least 1 of you.
