Without further ado, the winner of the 'Name-A-Comic' competition, after a well fought contest, was, with a well deserving submission, one, unknown to both Alex and I, named: Bill Curtis, with "Wrath of Odd".

I will be contacting Bill as soon as I finish this post to find out what prize he has selected. Thank you all who participated.
