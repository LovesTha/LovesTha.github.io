I attended the Tupperware conference on Saturday with Lierin. It was her first 
and I was intersted in experiencing one. I knew it was something I was only
likely to attend once, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't go that once. There 
were 900 people attending and that made for a fairly full hotel.

The day went along much as I'd expected, there was a higher focus and more time 
spend on recognising the sellers who'd achieved different goals or out performed
the rest of the sellers that I expected. I'd expected a large focus on new 
products, which there was but there was plenty more that could have been spoken 
about them. 

It also surprised me how much of the focus was July, there are two of these each 
year but with few exceptions the only time performance was rewarded was July. I
expect there is a reason that makes sense, but from this spectators seat it 
appeared odd. Can anyone enlighten me in the comments?

After everything was finished and we'd all oohed and ahhed over the new pieces of
plastic and other assorted materials that I can't tell anyone the details of, there 
was the typical post large event rush for the elevators. Also typically the lifts 
were working well below optimal efficiency because people were catching lifts in 
the wrong direction. There were two design issues that exacerbated this issue
compared to other times I have noticed it.

When there is a large queue for lifts, as typically happens in places that don't
have the capacity to cope with their largest spikes in usage people get impatient
and catch the next lift they can get into. They don't only get into a lift going the
right direction they just ride the lift to the extreme in one direction then all the 
way back to where they actually want to go. This causes issues when the lift goes 
past people who can't fit and they then have to wait for another lift. And because 
there are people waiting on every floor for a lift to go in the direction they want
with spare room for people the lifts have to stop at every floor even if no one 
can
