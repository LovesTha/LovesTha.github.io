I attended the Tupperware conference on Saturday with Lierin. It was her first 
and I was interested in experiencing one. I knew it was something I was only
likely to attend once, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't go that once. There 
were 900 people attending and that made for a fairly full hotel.

The day went along much as I'd expected, there was a higher focus and more time 
spend on recognizing the sellers who'd achieved different goals or out performed
the rest of the sellers that I expected. I'd expected a large focus on new 
products, which there was but there was plenty more that could have been spoken 
about them. 

It also surprised me how much of the focus was July, there are two of these each 
year but with few exceptions the only time performance was rewarded was July. I
expect there is a reason that makes sense, but from this spectators seat it 
appeared odd. Can anyone enlighten me in the comments?

After everything was finished and we'd all oohed and ahhed over the new pieces of
plastic and other assorted materials that I can't tell anyone the details of, there 
was the typical post large event rush for the elevators. Also typically the lifts 
were working well below optimal efficiency because people were catching lifts in 
the wrong direction. There were two design issues that exacerbated this issue
compared to other times I have noticed it.

When there is a large queue for lifts, as typically happens in places that don't
have the capacity to cope with their largest spikes in usage people get impatient
and catch the next lift they can get into. They don't only get into a lift going the
right direction they just ride the lift to the extreme in one direction then all the 
way back to where they actually want to go. This causes issues when the lift goes 
past people who can't fit and they then have to wait for another lift. And because 
there are people waiting on every floor for a lift to go in the direction they want
with spare room for people the lifts have to stop at every floor even if no one 
can get on, this slows the lift down a lot. 

Just guessing this causes the lifts to work at ~20% of optimal efficiency. If people
only got on a lift going the right way I'd expect that everyone would get to where 
they need to go in 1/3rd the time. To get that last 40% of optimal lifts would need
to know they are full and then skip requests other than by the people in the lift. 
That is more than I expect any normal hotel to manage, I don't think any lift 
anywhere does that.

But the Pullman Hotels lifts do a couple of things that make it harder for 
travellers to do the right thing. Their lifts are nice new models with LED displays
above the doors showing the current floor. Those displays can only be seen from a 
small range of viewing angles so it isn't possible to see all three displays at one 
time. Once a lift shows up the display doesn't show the direction the lift is going
to travel.

So when someone sees a lift they can get in and they don't know which way it is
going, they naturally get in. When it goes the wrong way they just keep riding till 
it loops around. Seeing people do this can make other people pretty angry. 

I was getting a bit hot under the collar. In the heat of the moment I was not 
giving people the benefit of the doubt or full weight to the reasons it was hard to
do the right thing, I was just jumping to the conclusion that they were being 
selfish.

The hotel does know that they need staff to assist in getting people through choke 
points quicker when their is high load. They had someone collecting parking tickets 
and the boom gate permanently up as operating the boom gate is too slow when 90%
of the car park wants to leave at the same time. It would also be good of them to
have someone corralling use of the lifts when there is a queue of a hundred people
trying to use 3 lifts.

The better solution would be to have an easy way for the users to see the direction 
the lift is travelling, I bet some of the users didn't even realize there were 
basement levels. 

Having the option of a stairwell would also improve the flow of people greatly.
