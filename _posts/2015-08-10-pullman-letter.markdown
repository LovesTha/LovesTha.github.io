I attended the Tupperware conference on Saturday with Lierin. It was her first 
and I was intersted in experiencing one. I knew it was something I was only
likely to attend once, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't go that once. There 
were 900 people attending and that made for a fairly full hotel.

The day went along much as I'd expected, there was a higher focus and more time 
spend on recognising the sellers who'd achieved different goals or out performed
the rest of the sellers that I expected. I'd expected a large focus on new 
products, which there was but there was plenty more that could have been spoken 
about them. 

It also surprised me how much of the focus was July, there are two of these each 
year but with few exceptions the only time performance was rewarded was July. I
expect there is a reason that makes sense, but from this spectators seat it 
appeared odd. Can anyone enlighten me in the comments?
