I think I'm mostly happy with the functionally of the blog theme now. If anyone
notices anything that clearly doesn't work or is buggy please let me know. If 
you just think the blog looks a bit simple or bland, don't worry I know. I'll 
do some more tweaks to that at some point, but it isn't going to suddenly 
become beautiful as that takes money I don't want to spend on this hobby.
