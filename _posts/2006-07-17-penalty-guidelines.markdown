I'm starting to notice a bit of a trend on the DCI Judge mailing list. Every question that relates to the Penalty Guidelines that doesn't have a nice clear and cut answer seams to get finally answered with a comment of 'heres an excerpt from the upcoming new PG'

This wouldn't be so annoying if the current PG wasn't put together so horridly. Take the deck/deck-list infractions, there's 6 of them. In reality there only needs to be 1: Illegal Deck &/or Deck-List, with the description of how to fix it being:

1) Remove cards from the physical deck until it is legal.
2) Add basic lands until the deck has enough cards.
3) Ensure that the decklist now matches the deck.
4) Issue a game loss.

That's it, sure this would mean that this section would have like 10 examples of how to fix things, but those 4 steps are pretty much it. Actually I can't think of anything that isn't covered by the above.

Doing this would remove like 3 pages from the document, and make [groking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) it so much easier. Then again, I guess this is why the DCI is going to release a new version of it :)
