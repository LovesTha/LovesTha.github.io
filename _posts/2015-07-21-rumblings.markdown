So recently a *thing* happened. Predictably the community reacted badly, but
I think that was sort of predictable. I'm unsure how avoidable it was, and
as I'm not a lawyer I'm not sure how valuable my commentary will be. But I
feel I need to at least write about it. The sanity in publishing it is much
easier to question, but I've never been shy of putting my foot in my mouth.

# The Situation

The cause of the *thing* was that a social media storm erupted about a 
convicted felon making top 8 of a GP. Some tweeter I've never heard of, I 
don't follow the professional Magic circuit that closely, was tweeting 
links to articles about his criminal past and the Internet was much a 
twitter with outrage.

Later the felon posted to Reddit a brief summary of his life since the 
conviction, he wasn't trying to diminish what he'd done, just show that it 
wasn't the start of a trend in his behaviour. It showed that he was working
at being both a good human and to bettering of society.

He didn't go into details about the crime it self, his early plea bargain
coupled with the nature of his crime to give him a short immediate 
custodial sentence (although with work release) with a much more significant 
one delayed. He has passed his bar entrance exam recently and when applying to 
become a member of the bar he only had to declare two minor traffic offences 
in addition to the significant crime that caused this *thing*. While the bar 
hasn't admitted him yet, they didn't knock him back they just deferred their 
decision till they have had more time to think about the situation.

Please don't take anything written here to indicate that I think his crime was 
not really a crime. Not all crimes are equal though, (sane) laws agree and 
allow judges significant discretion in the punishments they can hand out for 
the same basic crime. In my corner of the world Murder can get from life all 
the way down to a minor slap on the wrist (comparatively). In the lesser legal 
court of Magic cheaters get very different punishments, while they all get 
disqualified from the tournament some receive a sternly worded warning
letter and others receiving lengthy suspensions from the game.

Following the twitter storm there was a small but vocal group of people 
hassling WotC for a response about allowing this player to play in large
events. As his crime was violent towards a woman there were a lot of 
people clamouring for his scalp, and they were poking a hot topic right
now. As a community in whole we are trying pretty hard to make Magic a more 
welcoming community for everyone. Even those people who aren't young
white men. Apparently some of those people also have money and deserve to be
able to spend that money on enjoying themselves.

This all lead to the most recent update to the official list of suspended 
players including this criminal. He was given what is effectively a life ban. A
friend of his forwarded to Reddit a message explaining how little consultation
happened and that he is going to accept the punishment and look for other 
avenues to pass his time.

# Why Everyone Is Doing What They Are Doing

There are five groups that I've identified around this *thing*.

## The Felon Him Self

He really doesn't have many avenues available to him. Wizards of the Coast do
have the right to limit who participates in their marketing programs (more on 
that below). Taking it in a good natured way (at least in public) is really the
and only way he can try to sway the public opinion towards letting him play.

## The Lynch Mob

Fear of sexual predictors is a very strong emotion. That is a very reasonable 
thing, it's a despicable crime and those who do it have significant rates of
recidivism. 

Globally and particularly in the USA there has been a trend in recent years to
make the lives of convicted sex criminals harder and harder. They are agendas
pushed with the best interests of victims and the general public in mind. 
Registers and restrictions on where they live is common.

Coupled with the Magic communities push to be more inclusive this is a really 
bad time to have attention drawn to a criminal history that is characterised by
how it attacks one of the minorities that magic has lots of trouble attracting.

## The Jesus Figures

Yes this group is named provocatively. I think all the groups are named in an
aggressive way, but I didn't hold anything back for the group I mostly fall 
into. This is the group that think Wizards of the Coast should not have 
banned the felon. 

There are even some that think that the pro who *outed* him should be facing a 
ban, they don't think there is sufficient difference between shaming people for 
wearing their pants badly at tournaments and shaming someone for a crime they 
have served their time for.

Personally I think that as a Christian I'm to love everyone. Throwing people 
out of all future events because of a criminal past isn't showing love to them.
But rightly everyone should bring up the question of the safety of every other
player, spectator and worker at these events. That is a valid point, and if 
people were known for responding sensibly to fearful things, that causes me to
be happy that people bring up his conviction and educate people about what he
has shown he was capable of doing.

*deleted paragraph I talk about in [Footnote 1](#fn1)*

In light of there not being anything we should do differently around a rapist
compared to everyone else, I can't think of a good reason for the public to be
reminded of anyone's crimes.

## Wizards' Lawyers

This is the group that I suspect ultimately are winning this *thing*. The risk
of losing a law suit over having banned a player for no reason (not that this
is no reason, I'm just taking the extreme position) is a much smaller risk 
than a law suit arising from having a convicted felon committing a similar
offence at a Magic event.

That is sufficient reason without needing to look at factors of negative 
publicity this *thing* is generating or any other factors weighing into the
decision.

## Everyone Else

I thought it important to remind people that this is a *thing* that probably 
most Magic players will never have heard of. Most people just don't pay that 
much attention to organised play.

# Where To From Here

As I highly doubt Wizards of the Coast are going to change their mind and 
reverse his banning the most I think we can expect is clearer policies. 
Currently the grounds for his banning is just the general clause that Wizards
and everyone else includes where they feel appropriate that states their right 
to refuse anyone access to events for any undisclosed reason.

I would feel much better if Wizards of the Coast would create a player conduct
document that sets out some clear but general limits on what is acceptable for
players to do or have done. The document will probably not be perfect, but it
would need to have a place where it is clear that convicted rapists are going
to be banned for life or generally ineligible to play.

Doing this retrospectively isn't great, but it will clear up questions around
just how widely Wizards of the Coast will be applying this policy. There are
many people who are looking at their own convictions and wondering if it worth
their time, effort and money to try and compete in Magic at the highest levels.
Currently they have very little to go on when making that decision.

Personally I'd like to think that the policy wouldn't disallow players from 
having any form of criminal conviction, or at least that a single conviction
wasn't sufficient to bar a player. Multiple related convictions strikes me as
a much better threshold for permanent banning.

There are two things that I think would be acceptable for using single 
convictions as disqualification for. The first is the Magic Hall of Fame, 
letting people with serious marks against their name could easily be 
disallowed from the Hall without making any significant issues. It might be
seen as hypocritical though to disallow convicts when we allow players who
have served suspensions to be let in. Isn't being an upstanding player 
essential to the Hall?

The second would be tournament officials. In all of their different roles
officials are in positions of authority. Authority and convicts are a messy mix,
lets just avoid that and keep life simple. It is interesting to note that the
recently created Judge Code of Conduct doesn't appear to prohibit an active
judge from having any form of criminal conviction.

### <a name="fn1"></a>Footnote 1

The paragraph I deleted part way through writing was an abomination of a 
paragraph that I started writing based on some logic that looked really good at
first glance. But thinking about it enough to finish a paragraph I realised 
that it was a terrible piece of logic justifying victim blaming.

Why do I put this here? Because I know I've caused much anguish in some circles
by pointing out some victim blaming that was happening. So I'm calling out a 
case where I was doing it.

Something can be both innocent and terrible. It is all too easy. So many of the 
horrible things we can think, terrible destructive things that hold society 
back, are things that sound good and have (seemingly) good logic behind them. It 
takes practice and effort to avoid them.
