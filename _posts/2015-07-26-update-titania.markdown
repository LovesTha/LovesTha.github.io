I've got a Titania deck that I haven't played with very much, but there are 
lots of juicy cards for it in Magic Origins and I should probably update this 
deck to play in the [Commander League][1] on Monday.

I've played with this deck on two occasions, once against a family. That game 
ended simply when I cast Craterhoof Behemoth and Ambush Commander on the same
turn (but in the other order) and had 6 creatures who could attack. +22/+22 and
trample is pretty powerful.

The other occasion was a bunch of games against my brother in law, but the decks
were un-fun to play against each other so we'll just ignore those games. Really
I don't have much experience with the deck to start tinkering but the new origins

# Cards To Add

## Animist Awakening

This one I'm not to sure about, this deck does love getting a lot of lands into 
play but I'm not sure this is the greatest way to do it. Having a land density 
of 43% makes it pretty good though. I'm going to give it a run for a while, but
I expect it might not make the cut in the long run.

## Evolutionary Leap

This is a great way to restock when the inevitable board wipe happens. 
Restocking with a collection of creatures is about as good as it gets.

## Elemental Bond

Now the really great card. This is clearly the best card in Origins for this
deck. It is a real powerhouse that will draw a lot of cards. It'll make those
times where Titania dies the turn you cast her into good value.

## Nissa

Having a bit of upside compared to the old versions of the creature side is 
nice. The planeswalker side is okay, I think in this deck it is going to be
the +1 ability until the ultimate can be used. The -2 ability is not very
strong in this deck.
