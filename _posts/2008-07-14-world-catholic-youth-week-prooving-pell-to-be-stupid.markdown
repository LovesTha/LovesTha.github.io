So what have I learnt so far in the lead up to World Catholic Youth Week*?  Just that Cardinal Pell is an idiot, these are the things we've learnt about him:



	
  * He doesn't understand what Sexual Assault is.

	
  * Is sceptical about climate change**.

	
  * Believes the West needs to increase its birth rates to avoid a social crisis.


If I was catholic I would have to question if I want this man to be leading me.

* Its not World Youth Week, there needs to be a lot of non catholic focus for it to be that, the official name is just misleading.

** Ok, you can be that without being an idiot, and Pell appears to flip flop around on the issue any way.  As a custodian of the earth though he should be in favour of the solutions to climate change.
