I used to be a huge anti-fan of cricket, but recently my views have been changing a fair bit. I don't mind watching cricket on TV, but I do find watching cricket on the net great. I tend to have open the live score cards of the ABC and the ACC constantly.

I'm sure this isn't good for my productivity, but it is good for morale.

Go Aussies!
