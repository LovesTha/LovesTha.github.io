1) Only having 3 people turn up to the 2HG is making me seriously contemplate the future of the events. I will probably make the next one constructed (just to gauge interest) and am interested in what people would prefer: Time Spiral Block or Highlander.

2) Played in Victorian Regionals yesterday. What a failure. I dropped after the 3rd round, having only won a single round. My deck wasn't doing that it should and it was getting in the way of me having fun.

3) I just cut off ~95% of my hairÂ  (by volume).
