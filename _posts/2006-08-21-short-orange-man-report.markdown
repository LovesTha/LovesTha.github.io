Unfortunately there were only 6 players for the extended tourney at Card Heaven this week, but we still had plenty of fun. I managed to take the list I put together to a 2-1 record, earning my self 3rd place (the drawn match made the 3 round 6 player tournament even weirder than normal). I was quite happy with that result considering that I had quite a few sub optimal cards in the deck. I'll post the deck list tonight, but having 0 Hierarchs was far from optimal and had me relying on mana screw to beat some opponents :(
