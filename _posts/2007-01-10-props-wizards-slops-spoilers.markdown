This is the first time I've said this, I feel that spoilers have stolen something from me. The [announcement](http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/13483.html) of The Lovely Mares tribute card by Jamie Wakefeild was so much hollower because we'd already seen most of the text of the card already (I don't actually mind that the casting cost was wrong, that's not that relevant to me.

Part of the value of the card is that it was announced by Jamie, I feel sorry for the people that wont have heard about the card from Jamie's article before the read about it on a spoiler or by opening a pack.

The printing of this card also validates the policy of not printing lots of cards that are anagrams of friends and such. If they were doing that a lot this card wouldn't be very special.
