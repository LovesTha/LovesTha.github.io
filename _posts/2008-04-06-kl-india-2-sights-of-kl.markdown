Having had a quick shower and arguments over who would use the included breakfasts, no one ended up having breakfast, such a useful argument, we head down to the concierge and hire a mini van + driver.

The first port of call is the Batu Caves. They are set of caves on the outskirts of KL that has a Hindu temple built into it. The temple it self isn't that impressive, but the huge standing girl Budda out the front is quite impressive. Its about the same height as the 272 stairs you climb to get into the caves :).
