For a look into the future of rules get primed by this [document](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/MTGFUT%20primer%20032507.doc).

Its essential for people wishing to lessen the confusion of the prerelease slightly. I expect this PR will be plenty confusing even after reading that doc.

PS: Please vote for the [Comic Name](http://www.polldaddy.com/poll.asp?p=29746).
