One of the guys who comes along to my Two Headed Giant tournaments (need I remind you that the next one will have a DCI foil Vampiric Tutor up to be won) asked me for my thoughts on how to create a reanimation deck. So naturally I'm posting my answer on my blog :) Talk about killing two birds with one stone.<!-- more -->

Firstly we need to determine what the decks game plan is pretty obviously this is:



	
  1. Get big dudes into the graveyard

	
  2. Get them into play via reanimation

	
  3. Not die before getting to this point


Next we have to pick the colours for the deck, naturally we're going to have to play Black to have enough reanimation spells to make the deck work. Lets examine the other colours counter clockwise.

Red, only brings us efficient creatures and burn, pretty pointless to the decks long term plan so lets keep moving.

Green gives us some good ways to not loose the game and will let us cast the game winning spells but doesn't help us with the first part of the game plan.

White will help us not loose but really wont give us many options on advancing points 1 or 2.

Blue on the other hand, blue does everything. It helps us get fatties into the graveyard (Compulsive Research). Helps us draw our reanimation spells (Compulsive Research). Helps us not loose the game (Compulsive Research, ok, really all of the available counter spells). So lets settle on blue as our second colour.

To build deck you'll need:
12 counter spells, at least 6 of the them need to be hard counter spells, and at least 6 of them need to cost 2 mana or less.

8 draw spells definitly including Thirst for Knowledge or Compulsive research, depending on the format your playing.

then we needs about 5 or 6 creatures that are really scary in play, they need to be hard to remove and have evasion, really you have lots of options here.

I'm not going to go into specifics right now, mainly because its too late at night and I really need to go to bed.
