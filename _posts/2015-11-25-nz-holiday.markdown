I'm sorry for the lack of recent updates. A holiday in New Zealand with my wife 
is the reason I didn't post for the last two weeks, but there is no good reason 
for the week or two before that. This post is going to diverge from the usual
topics on this blog and briefly mention a few of the highlights from the trip. 
If any of these brief comments inspire any curiosity please ask in the comments
below, I'll try to answer. Really good questions will demand a detailed post in
reply.

There was no particular reason behind this holiday, just that we wanted to go on
a holiday and New Zealand is both cheap and a great place to visit. I had been
on a two week tour of the South Island roughly ten years ago with my sister, it 
was a graduation celebration for both of us, but Lierin had never visited 
Hobbiton before. Since my first trip I've also been to Auckland a half dozen or
more times and visited Rotorua. I wasn't particularly interested in going to the 
North Island.

We flew into Wellington on the red eye from Melbourne. This was one of my first
red eye flights and I was surprised how much sleep we managed. With New Zealand
being East of Melbourne the red eye is in the bad direction for jet lag, making
our first day in New Zealand hard to remember through the sleepyness. 

That may also be the third leg in the story that ends up with me buying the
wrong SIM card. Flying out of Melbourne so late the store that sells foreign 
SIM cards was already closed. Arriving so early in Wellington the Vodafone store
at the airport wasn't open yet. After dropping our bags off at our hostel the 
main phone stores weren't open yet. So I end up buying a Vodafone SIM from a 
convienance store. But it's the wrong one and I end up with only 7 days of data
and the cost of a recharge for data for the last 5 days feels too steep to me.

We had lunch plans with the Wellington Level 2 Magic judges but that was several 
hours away. We spent the morning exploring the harbour front area and Cuba 
Street. My highlight of this was discovering the Ekim burger place that looked
worth heading back to for dinner Sunday night.
