There are so many options for a good rock deck these days. If your looking at an aggressive version these are what I'd consider auto includes:

4x Birds of Paradise
4x Umezawa's Jitte
4x Hypnotic Specter
4x Dryad Sophisticate
4x Dark Confidant
4x Putrefy
4x Moldervine Cloak

Thats 28 slots that I consider non negotiable. These collection of cards gives you many very very strong turn three game states:
Bird +  Hyppie = Hitting with Hyppie on turn 3 + relevant plays
Bird + Cloak = 3/4 flyer on turn 3 + relevant plays
Bird + Hyppie + Cloak = Hitting with a 5/5 Hyppie on turn 3
Bird + 2 Cloaks = Hitting with 6/7 bird on turn 3
Sophisticate + Cloak = Connecting with a 5/4 on turn 3

This is what a deck wants to do, the question is how to fill out the 2 non land slots, should you go with white?
4x Shrieking Grotesque
4x Mortify
4x Vitu Ghazi, City Tree

or with red:
4x Kird Ape
4x Savage Twister

The white option, has a strong late game, but forces you to play more shock lands as your running 4 copies of a colourless land. The red option has worse mana as you only have access to two shock lands.
I think the two options come down to which is better in this deck, Savage Twister or Mortify. Savage Twister is horrible for you if you haven't got a Moldervine Cloak in play, but then its completely nuts.

Should I manage to find something to cut for Sensei Diving Tops to help protect my life total from Bob? I think the risk of bob is acceptable, there is only 12 cards with a casting cost of 3, everything else is a lowly 2 or 1. I can also fry him if I must.

So that's the deck list I'll be trying to use at some standard tournaments in the next few weeks. (naturally with some mana base costing way too much money)
