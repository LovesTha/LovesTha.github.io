This weekend wasn't what I exspected.

Friday night I had to do something I hate doing and rarely do: call in sick. Luckily for me Mark was still on IRC when I decided it was implausible that I would be well enough to judge the next daw as I don't have his phone number (probably should fix this). I felt like I had heat stroke which was odd as I'd been in an office with air conditioning all day. I went to bed at 8.30pm.<!-- more -->

When I woke up in the morning (~9.30am) I was still feeling quite poorly, and pottered around the house for a few hours, by lunch time I felt that I was just well enough to head in and play in a flight. Once I got to the city I had a few unpleasant trips to the toilet and decided that it wasn't heat stroke but something related to food/digestion :( But being a true geek and male I decided to join the afternoon flight anyway.

Boy did I get a bad pool though, all the usual bad suspects like Norin showed their head. The only rare or timeshifted card to make my deck was Jedit Ojanen of Efrava, although I was fairly happy as I had a Tromp the Domains in the deck :). Unfortunately I only managed to drag out a 2-2 record for the flight, although pulling a Damnation was plenty fine with me.

I was feeling much better by Sunday morning so I made it into town in time to play in both the morning and afternoon flights. Unfortunately I didn't manage to do any better, 4-3 I had to leave after 2 games in the last round, we'd split the first 2 games in under 20minutes. So we agreed to a prize split and then I conceeded to get to a party.

My impressions of Planar Chaos? Its interesting, but not as interesting as the previous 4 releases. I'm sure it'll be fun to play with though.
