I'm trying frantically to get some tickets to the AIH show at the Northcote social club next week. It's proving to be rather annoying. Don't radio stations realize that forcing fans of bands to listen to the 1 station for ~14 hours a day in attempts to get tickets to a show is counter productive? Pretty much every radio station is really annoying to listen to if you are forced to do it for too long each day.

Also annoying me currently is that when they say "in just a little while" it really means somewhere in the order 1 hour 15 minutes. Who are they trying to impress? Its not like JJJ needs to turn a profit.
