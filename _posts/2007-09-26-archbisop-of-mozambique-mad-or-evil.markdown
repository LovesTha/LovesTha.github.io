It is being [widely reported](http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L26350073.htm) today that the Archbisop of Mozambique believes that "_two countries in Europe who are making condoms with (the) virus on purpose, they want to finish with African people as part of their programme to colonise the continent_" and "_some companies who are manufacturing anti-retroviral drugs already infected with the virus, also in order to finish quickly the African people_"

I fail to understand the agenda of such people? Making such wild claims is attempting to finish of the African people. Every time he discourages people to use condoms he encourages AIDs. Isn't it best to preach "If you insist on ignoring our principles on when to have sex, please also use a condom?"

People following catholic values to the letter help to slow the spread of AIDs, its the people who selectively follow the rules that are to blame. Do people really feel that easy sex is a lesser evil than contraception? I could believe that of the uneducated masses, but of the educated heads of church?

Grow up people.
