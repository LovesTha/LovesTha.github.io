So I'm going to post some rambling thoughts today. I'm not expecting there to be anything much of 
interest in here, but I'll try and summarize my current status and outlook.

# Personal

I'm very happy to have known Lierin for nearly 42 moons and to have been married to her for 55% of 
that time. After living in my/our one bedroom apartment in Ivanhoe for over a year we have moved 
into a two bedroom unit in Ringwood. It has been a time of many many first for us and we are really 
enjoying life these days.

# Health

I had ballooned up to 137kg on the 11th of April 2013, this morning I was at 113kg. That is a loss 
of 24kg (53 pounds for the American's reading). I'm pretty happy with loosing on average nearly 1kg 
a month for over 2 years. That period has had lots of plateaus and even a few hills (I'm looking at 
you USA trip!).

Things look even more aggressive when you look at the 9kg I've lost since the start of May. That is 
an average loss of 128g/day or 900g/week. Okay, it's pretty obvious that I've learned that tracking 
lots of different number is a great way for me to maintain focus and motivation for losing weight.

As to the question of how I'm doing it I'll leave that for a few future posts. In brief I've had 
good success over the years with radically low carbohydrate diets, sometimes vaguely following advice
from [Tim Ferriss's][2] [Four Hour Body book][3], but am currently just eating less. Oh and exercising more.
Every weekend I'm trying to go for a ~2 hour ride, some weekends it is a bit less when the weather is 
less kind, but every weekend that I'm not away on holiday I'm going for a ride. I'm also going for a
30 minute walk most lunches. This combination has been the plan for the last 9 weeks.

# Fitness

As I said, I'm doing a fair bit of cycling at the moment, but I'm about to start a bit of a push back into yoga and
general fitness things (push ups, sit ups, etc).

# Hobbies

I'm going to break this one down a bit, but you might notice that they are all broadly 'gaming'

## Magic: The Gathering

After my playing waning heavily 5 years ago and my judging waning a bit in the last 2~3 years, I've
gotten back into judging a little bit more. The need for L2 judges to run PPTQs (the new preliminary
round of qualification to the Pro Tour, it now takes two rounds of qualification to get to the Pro 
Tour) has made me judge a local event every month this year, I even did 4 events across back to back 
weekends in January! And then their was the prerelease weekend. 

The move to Ringwood has also helped increase my playing a little bit as [Next Level Games Ringwood][1]
is so close to us now and it is a store I enjoy playing and judging at. That isn't to say the store is 
perfect, but it is within my comfort zone and I hope to be a positive force in shaping its culture.

I'm still managing to participate in every prerelease, since the original Mirrodin, and am really 
enjoying the recent tradition of doing a Two Headed Giant event with my brother in law W. Unfortunately
the proximity of the large set release date to our wedding anniversary is probably going to put and end
to that run at some point, but hopefully that date is far in the future.

Finally two judge projects have accepted me, so I've got a bit of work to do in that area of judging as
well. It feels good to be part of such an awesome community.

## Board Games

I'm getting into board games a bit more recently. I've always enjoyed them, but in days by gone I never
had enough time for them with how much mtg I was playing. Another factor in this upswing is that the 
church we have joined in Ringwood, [UrbanLife][4], runs a month board game night: [UrbanGamer][5].

### Board Games With Lierin

Lierin and I are also enjoying playing some board games at home by our selves. We have been having trouble 
finding awesome games for 2 players, [Foursite][6] has been a hit but we are getting into a new favourite
of mine: [Smash Up][7]. 

Foursite is a tile placing game, with tiles with 4 symbols random taken from the 4 different symbols in 
the game. Tiles are placed in a grid with adjacent symbols having to match. Points are scored for each 
symbol you match and for enclosing an area.

Smash Up calls it self a 'shuffle building' game. You pick two tribes and shuffle the 20 cards from each 
tribe together. The game is played by placing Minions on a Base, when the Minions from all players on the 
base have enough power to smash the Base up the players get victory points based on their rank determined 
by how much power each player controlled at that base. There are also Action cards that can do anything,
some are single effects and others do something continually or once a turn. Minions also have a similar 
range of abilities.

It's rare that I enjoy a game mostly because of it's flavour but Smash Up is definitely one, just love
pairing up really weird combinations. Who just doesn't love the idea of Pirates and Magical Ponies 
teaming up?

# Wrap Up

So that was a friendly little meander through where things are up to in my life right now. There are plenty
of things I've skipped over that I'll mention in more depth later and other things that I've not mentioned 
at all.
