Wizards has gotten around to putting a Miniature database up on the web at [http://dreamcatcher.wizards.com/](http://dreamcatcher.wizards.com/)

This is a very good database with a powerful filter feature, I wish Magic's Gatherer was this good

Also why don't DreamBlade Minis have a sculpture credit on the base?
