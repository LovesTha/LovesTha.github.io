Just a collection of thoughts about the nations capital:

  * Student concessions on public transport are only for ACT students and students from other countries

  * Just because a judge is judging at nationals doesn't mean they understand the rules well

  * Just because a judge is head judging a nationals side event doesn't mean they understand the rules

  * Vintage players should have to call a judge over in the first place to work out how much Yawgmoth's Will (or an Ornithopter) costs to play under Sphere of Resistance and Trinisphere (its 3 you bozos).

Whoops there I go diverting into a rant, tsk tsk.
