I've started reading comics, for a long time now I've been reading quite a few web comics. There are 24 web comics on my iGoogle page. Not all of the actually update, but most of them do and I really enjoy them. Recently, due to a [blogging god](http://kingfatty.blogspot.com/) of mine giving a [list of real comics he thinks are worth reading](http://kingfatty.blogspot.com/2010/02/miracleman-and-other-comics.html). So I'm most of the way through Miracle Man and have The Watchmen lying around waiting to be read.

It wont surprise many of you to learn that I love Buffy, so when I heard about the cannon continuation of the Buffy story line (commonly referred to as Buffy Season 8) I had to grab it and read it. So this last week I've spent some of my spare time reading the 34 comics. I must say they are fantastic. The story is enthralling and the art is great.

But its a comic, comics are worse than TV shows, with TV you only have to wait a week for the next episode. Comics are typically monthly! Heck, this most recent Buffy #34 < Spoiler > is just one long sex scene < /spoiler >. Sure there's some juxtaposed explanation of the previous plot lines, but really it is just one scene.

It took me maybe 5-10 minutes to read and now to wait another month (actually this wait might be shorter, as I didn't read it till well after the release date I believe). I have a feeling I'll keep reading each month through the end of Season 8 (another 6 comics) then not start reading Season 9 till it is finished.

PS: When is Xander going to kiss a guy? Not that I'll particularly enjoy it, but nearly every other long running character has had some gay action, why not Xander?
