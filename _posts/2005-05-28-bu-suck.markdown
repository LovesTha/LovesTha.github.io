Ok that idea sucked. Not only do all of the pieces, while they seam decent on their own, do all that much when not comboing. But they also never draw anywhere near early enough to lock the opponent down to no new cards for it to matter.

I think I need to do 2 things to this list to get it respectable, add more good cards, and more removal.  Preferably both.

So how's this look?




4x Skull Collector  

4x Aether Vial  

2x Chittering Rats  

4x Ravenous Rats  

4x Distress  

4x Nezumi Shortfang  

3x Kiku's Whisper  

4x Hideous Laughter  

2x Rend Flesh  

3x Sickening Shoal  

2x Kokusho, the Evening Star




4x Tendo's Icebridge  

4x Salt Marsh  

4x Island  

1x Minamo, School at Water's Edge  

1x Shizo, Death's Storehouse  

10x Swamp
