Long time no post eh? This ones for you Dad, your one of two people who mentions to me that I don't update this place often enough. It's not quiet for you Scott as its not a burger review :)

After the PTQ at Melbourne High yesterday Russell and I headed up Chapel Street looking for a place to grab a bite to eat at 8:00pm. A block along we decided to take the next car park and then walk to find somewhere to eat. After a 15point attempt at reverse parallel parking we jumped out and walked about 5m before deciding that the place directly across the street looked good.

It was a nice simple looking Pizza/Pasta place called [The Old Pepper](http://www.theoldpepper.com.au/index.html). The place looked new and clean and the menu by the front door proudly proclaimed nothing over $20 so we felt like we were in for a good evening. As we walked in the guy working the pizza oven casually asked if we wanted a table and as we did handed us over to the bubbly little waitress. Little doesn't mean she was young but she would have been all of 4'10". This is a nice height for a waitress as she doesn't have to look down to people sitting at tables :)<!-- more -->

We were handed a pair of menu's and even these had the good feel of quality to them. Our expectations were being exceeded in every way. This is something I like :)

We both order pasta dishes and in what feels like 10 seconds our meals are brought out to us. Ok it was more like 5-10 minutes, and the place was nearly empty but the service was quick and friendly. So naturally I was exspecting the pasta to be like rubber and the sauce to taste like dish water.

As is the theme of this review my expectation was wrong, the meal was great. There was not a single thing wrong with the experience.

Scores:
Menu: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Service: 5/5
Cost: 4/5
Value: 5/5
Overall Experience: 5/5 (this is not an average)

I highly recommend this place. I know I'll be back in the future.
