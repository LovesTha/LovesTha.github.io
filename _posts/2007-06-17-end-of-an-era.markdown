I'm sad to announce that Northern Magic will stop running its monthly Two Headed Giant events. This is due to two factors, both of them with equal weight:



	
  * Â Not meeting goals: When we started running these events it was an attempt to build a community, the events were doing that very well so there was little desire to continue them

	
  * Low attendance: The attendance at the events wasn't high enough for us to run them purely as a service.


So watch this space, I will return to organizing something, not sure what.
