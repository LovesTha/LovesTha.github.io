Ok, this list of enemy generals isn't going to be very complex, as there aren't all that many :(

Experiment Kraj 2GGUU
Legendary Creature -- Ooze Mutant
4/6.
Experiment Kraj has all activated abilities of each other creature with a +1/+1 counter on it.
T: Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature.

I like where this deck pushes you, but I can't think of any suficiently fun combos. If you can, go ahead.

Momir Vig, Simic Visionary 3GU
Legendary Creature -- Elf Wizard
2/2.
Whenever you play a green creature spell, you may search your library for a creature card and reveal it. If you do, shuffle your library and put that card on top of it.
Whenever you play a blue creature spell, reveal the top card of your library. If it's a creature card, put that card into your hand.

This on the other hand looks really good. Although their doesn't seem to be enough UG creatures (only 16 others) to let you reliably trigger both abilities at once. Unless you get a good combo going. He does let you tutor for the 3,4,6&9 drop transmuters though, which should be a strong engine.

I exspect I will see several fun decks built around both of the above cards, if for no other reason than they are in a popular colour combination.
