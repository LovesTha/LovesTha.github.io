I'm not completely sure what the hype is all about. Yes the card does exactly what it says it does. Its just that trading with a creature in an agro matchup or drawing a few cards against control doesn't seam to be as good as everyone's saying.

The other side of the problem is that green always has lots of really good 3 drops. So lets go have a look at all the legal standard creatures with casting cost of 2G:<!-- more -->



	
  1. Azusa, Lost but Seeking

	
  2. Civic Wayfinder

	
  3. Descendant of Masumaro

	
  4. Elder Pine of Jukai

	
  5. Ghost-Lit Nourisher

	
  6. Gristleback

	
  7. Isao, Enlightened Bushi

	
  8. Ivy Dancer

	
  9. Kami of the Hunt

	
  10. Ley Druid

	
  11. Loaming Shaman

	
  12. Matsu-Tribe Decoy

	
  13. Orochi Eggwatcher

	
  14. Reki, the History of Kamigawa

	
  15. Rootwalla

	
  16. Shidako, Broodmistress

	
  17. Silhana Starfletcher

	
  18. Trophy Hunter

	
  19. Viridian Shaman

	
  20. Wood Elves

	
  21. Yavimaya Enchantress


Ok so none of them are playable, what about that cost 1GG:

	
  1. Budoka Pupil

	
  2. Carven Caryatid

	
  3. Dosan the Falling Leaf

	
  4. Elvish Champion

	
  5. Gnarled Mass

	
  6. Golgari Brownscale

	
  7. Ichiga, Who Topples Oaks

	
  8. Kashi-Tribe Elite

	
  9. Sasaya, Orochi Ascendant

	
  10. Scion of the Wild

	
  11. Shizuko, Caller of Autumn

	
  12. Trained Armodon

	
  13. Verduran Enchantress


Ok so Carven Caryatid is playable, maybe we have something good at GGG:

[09:45:06] <cerberos> search color=green cost=ggG set=t2 type=creature
[09:45:07] -Datatog- No matches found.

Ok, so maybe we have lots of new playable 3 drops for green in Coldsnap:

[09:45:51] <cerberos> search color=green cost=2G set=csp type=creature
[09:45:52] -Datatog- Unique match: Frostweb Spider {2G} |Snow Creature -- Spider| 1/3. Frostweb Spider can block as though it had flying. / Whenever Frostweb Spider blocks a creature with flying, put a +1/+1 counter on Frostweb Spider at end of combat. CSP-C [Not tournament legal. Enters Vin Leg Ext Std Aug 20.]

Or 1GG:

[09:46:12] <cerberos> search color=green cost=1GG set=csp type=creature
[09:46:13] -Datatog- Unique match: Ohran Viper {1GG} |Snow Creature -- Snake| 1/3. Whenever Ohran Viper deals combat damage to a creature, destroy that creature at end of combat. / Whenever Ohran Viper deals combat damage to a player, you may draw a card. CSP-R [Not tournament legal. Enters Vin Leg Ext Std Aug 20.]

Ok, so this isn't looking good, GGG?:

[09:46:41] <cerberos> search color=green cost=GGG set=csp type=creature
[09:46:42] -Datatog- No matches found.

Ok so Ohran Viper and Carven Caryatid isn't really a crowded 3 drop for a green deck. Maybe it is that good :)
