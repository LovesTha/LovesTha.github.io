I've been listening to a fair bit of Kimya Dawson of late. The majority of her songs have a political message, and as I agree with her political opinion that's a good thing :)

The most recent song to capture me though is 12/26. Named as a parody of 9/11, its about the Boxing Day Tsunami. It has some very graphic images through out, have a read:

One of her babies is rotting in the sun
And the other one was found drowned in the ocean
Her mom and dad are in their van crushed and bloated
And her husband was thrown from his fishing boat<!-- more -->

So please give me a break from all your complaining
About who was mean to you and how your step-dad is a pain
I care, I swear, but I just can't take it, not today
All I can think about are tsunamis and earthquakes

Everything she's ever known is gone, gone, gone
Everyone she's ever loved is gone, gone, gone
The only reason she's alive is
She grabbed a palm frond, and held on
And held on

You can call me crazy but it seems to me
We could have sent more than we spend in one day killing Iraqis
To help the hundreds of thousands who are injured and diseased
And hungry and homeless and without families

I'm appalled by our government's initial reaction
And the fact that they asked for a verbal retraction
From the folks who called them stingy, they're just covering their assets
Well they think they're greedy god for wiping out the lower class

Everything she's ever known is gone, gone, gone
Everyone she's ever loved is gone, gone, gone
The only reason she's alive is
She grabbed a palm frond, and held on
And held on

One of her babies is rotting in the sun
And the other one was found drowned in the ocean
Her mom and dad are in their van, they're crushed and bloated
And her husband was thrown from his fishing boat

We'd have 12/26 tattooed across our foreheads
If something this atrocious happened on our coast instead
Well a tragedy's a tragedy no matter where it happens
Close your eyes really tight and imagine
That everything you've ever known is gone
And everyone you've ever loved is gone
And the only reason you're alive
Is you were lucky and you were strong enough to hold on
While you watched your family die
While you watched your family die
While you watched your family die
While you watched your family die

Everything she's ever known is gone, gone, gone
Everyone she's ever loved is gone, gone, gone
The only reason she's alive is
She grabbed a palm frond, and held on
And held on
