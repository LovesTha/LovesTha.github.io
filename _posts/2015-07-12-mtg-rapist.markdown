Okay I am working on a more well thought out post that may never reach the day 
of light but to research the post even vaguely well I needed to do a Google 
search for "mtg rapist". 

I was quite sad to find a link to a deck-list on [TappedOut][1] that has the 
name "Rapist". I'm not going to link to it as I don't want to encourage anyone 
to use that name for a deck. The deck is empty and it was created 3 years ago 
and hasn't been edited since. I'm hoping that it was created as a joke and and 
I was guessing that the account that created it was a throw away account as the 
name is "beyondterror101", but he has 50 completed decks on there. His other 
deck list names appear to be quiet reasonable and are just his riffs on common 
decks.

Anyway that was all, if anyone would like to comment with anything sad and 
crazy they have seen today we can shake our heads in unison.
