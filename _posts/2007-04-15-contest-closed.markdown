Just letting everyone know that the Name A Comic contest has finished and I just emailed Alex a list of 36 submissions to choose from. Naturaly I've already thrown a few out (for some reason naming a comic after a major magic web site doesn't sound smart) and we hope to get the poll up in the next few days for you all to vote on.

PS: wasn't the weather beautiful yesterday in Victoria? I spent most of the day on the top of a mountain watching a cricket match, fantastic.
