Darryl Gardner told us at the intensive about a 'thing' he and his wife have been doing for a while. They call it Beach Curry because they serve curry and live at the beach. So one night a week they serve curry. No agenda, no goals, just curry.

Sure good friendships are formed over the curry. They're allowed to form naturally, but they are not forced. If you want to turn up, eat some curry and leave, that's fine. There is no advertising, and all requests for visits to learn the model are rejected, there is no <strike>spoon</strike> model.<!-- more -->

Now, you can insist that there is no model and all that till you're blue in the face, but it doesn't mean there isn't one. The mere inclusion of it in a discussion about discipleship means that you think it is important.

The community that has formed around Beach Curry is very healthy, people feel free to come and relax. It has given its <strike>members</strike> participants local people to relate to and be supported by.

This sounds like what we all dream of building.

It does raise a very prominent question for my own mission. How formal should be what we run? Should it be carefully structured, with an order of service. Or should I just make a space available for the playing of games?

I was leaning towards the more formal style of meeting, but am seriously questioning it now.
