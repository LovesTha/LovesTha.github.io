Just heard about this format that has grabbed my attention: Big Box Sealed. Everyone receives a display box of boosters. Opens all 36 boosters, and builds a 40 card deck.

So its just normal sealed, but with 36 boosters instead of 5. It seems to be the most efficient way of having fun while opening boosters, that is if you measure efficiency in terms of packs/hour.

I'm hoping I can get some people together to do it at the cave, please contact me if you'd be interested in doing this with 10th edition (black borders are kewl) or with Lorwyn when they come out.
