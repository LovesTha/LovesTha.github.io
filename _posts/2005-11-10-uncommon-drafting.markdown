The other day I was doing a draft with ~10 people (if my recollection holds) and managed to draft one of the best piles of uncommons I've ever managed. I opened a Moldervine Cloak and Putrefy in Packs 1 and 2. A Darkblask also came past pretty early and by the end of the draft I had in my pile:

Moldervine Cloak
Putrefy
Darkblast
Carrion Howler
Spectral Searchlight
Nullmage Shepherd
Ethereal Usher
Netherborn Phalanx
Wojek Apothecary
Telling Time
Flame-Kin Zealot
Indentured Oaf

I had to cut the red white cards, as no one should get a Flame-Kin Zealot as 4th last pick in pack 3, let alone have him followed by the Oaf and Apothecary.
Some how I still managed to go less than stellar but, that pile of uncommons must have half paid for the draft on their own. And all the on colour ones (GBu) made the deck or were sideboarded in a few times.
