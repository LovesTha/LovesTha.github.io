I've been trying to get MythTV of one form or another setup for a quite a while. I've only been trying on and off, but the difficultly in setting it up is surprising me. I haven't yet found a good install guide for any of the distributions of MythTV.

I'm trying to use a video card that has to have the driver told which card/tuner combination your using, but no guide tells you when to set this up. I mustn't be the only person to need to do such a custom step, the card I'm using is reasonably common and the driver it uses supports many popular cards. My proficiency with computers and Linux is great enough that I can find how to set my card up, but I know too little of the MythTV setup processes that getting it to go smoothly is very hard.

Now for the next distribution to try. I hop this one is easier.
