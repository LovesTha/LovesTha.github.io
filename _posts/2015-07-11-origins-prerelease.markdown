# Today

Today I played Two-Headed Giant at [Next Level Games Ringwood][1] with my 
brother in law Wayne. Weirdly 3 of the 4 teams we played had food based 
names matching our entry level riff on our surnames (it doesn't take much
when you start with Pye).

# The Event

It was my first time doing a Prerelease at NLRG, I was surprised with how 
quiet the event was. I think the store was a little disappointed with the 
numbers but we all had a lots of fun and it is nice when there is enough 
room to spread your elbows out and leave a bag on a table. I wonder how much
of the average turn out was due to people not grokking that this wasn't a 
core set. There are lots of people that aren't that well connected to the
major sources of news and also people who skip, or do less flights at, 
core set prereleases and the intersection of those two groups can account
for many of the people missing this weekend.

Or people who don't believe Wizards of the Coast when they inform us of how
awesome their new product is. It's a pretty reasonable type of skepticism.
It is a skepticism that helps us filter out all of the overly optimistic
marketing we are bombarded with. Personally I think that WotC have done 
pretty well at being honest with us players, at least when their lawyers 
aren't tying their hands but that is a topic for another longer more in
depth post (one I'll start a draft of soon, expect to see the article in
around 6 months time).

# Our Performance

Onto our actual cards, we picked Green and Blue for our prerelease packs
(which is a rabbit hole I'm not really interested in discussing). Green
because Wayne loves him some nature loving fatties and Blue because it 
wasn't very popular and I didn't really care. Wayne's pack had the new 
[Forgotten Ancient][2], [Managorger Hydra][3], and another regular copy in 
the pool. I'm pretty happy to trade the ability to move the counters around 
for trample. Those beaters probably accounted for at least two of our 
wins, the third win it was really just the random creature that meant we 
won one turn earlier, wining was never in question that game. My promo was 
the new hot merfolk, [Harbinger of the Tides][4], so I was happy with the 
value but the blue really did suck so we left all the blue cards on the 
bench.

My deck ended up being a RW skies deck. We had 3 pieces of equipment that 
needed to be played with the pair of [Iroas's Champions][5]. It was pretty 
convenient as we also had three of the red three drops that come with a 1/1
Thopter and a small collection of white flyers that would have been worth 
playing on their own but were really good with some equipment to strap on.

Wayne's deck was BG as he wanted to play elves, but during construction we 
realised he just didn't have enough of the good tribal elves to force the 
idea so he ended up on generic BG with some ramp and lots of good creatures.
His combat tricks were also really good.

One of my favourite interactions in the matches was having my Iroas's 
Champion chump blocked by goblin tokens for 5 turns in a row as they were 
scared of a surprise [Titan's Strength][6] blowing them out. The irony was
that there were three of them in my sideboard that I just couldn't find room 
for. Yes I know they are great, but the rest of the deck felt really solid 
without them and three equipment is already a lot of creature pump without 
going to ones that increase the chances of enemies removal blowing us out.

Another MVP for us was [Wild Instincts][7], it even combined with a black 
creature with death touch to kill [Gaea's Revenge][8]. It took our opponents 
a few moments to realise that the play was legal. 

# Set Reflections

Building our decks and during play the 'origins' theme didn't come across
strongly. I suspect this was because we weren't doing anything to 
intentionally engage in the flavour, which is pretty common in a competitive
environment. Having so many different stories going on and on so many 
different worlds makes it pretty hard for the set to have enough of a theme
to slap a tournament player in the Vorthosian organ so they notice.

But onto the cards themselves, they were a lot of fun to play with. The deck
building felt complex with plenty of themes to pick from and enough powerful
cards to make good decks. That bodes pretty well for drafting the set, it
wont be as boring as many core sets have been to draft. It still suspect it'll 
be less fun than most of the recent block draft formats though, but that is a 
very high bar to fall short of.

The speed of the Two-Headed Giant format was faster than some recently but
not too fast to be interactive or fun. Only two of our opponents were light 
enough on mana for it to overwhelmingly impact the match, so things were 
plenty of fun.

I'm not going to be ignorant enough to pretend I have anything interesting to 
say regarding how the set might do in Standard, or other constructed formats,
so you'll need to go to any of the other thousand articles people who care 
about those formats will write.

# Meta-Set Reflections

I'm really happy with how long term WotC is being with this set. As the last 
Core Set it reflects that they are happy to stop doing something they've been 
doing for over 20 years. Regular Core Set releases have been an important 
corner stone of how Magic has been produced for it's entire life. But in the 
face of customers continually telling them, in the most important way: with 
their wallets, that Core Sets just aren't fun they have changed direction.

Also being willing to drop the three sets per block model at the same time is 
an awesome progression. The number of problems this solves will be great. Not 
having a dud set, or two, every year will make stores much easier to manage. 
Cash flow will be much more consistent which I can only image will be a great
boon for them. 

The 6 monthly rotation of Standard will also help to prop the stores up, card
price fluctuations is how people trading things can make a profit. It does 
mean that making a profit from singles will be fraught with greater downsides:
every 6 months things will rotate out, you really don't want to be caught with
a full stock of something with zero appeal outside of Standard.

The greater focus on the needs of the story is also great to see. I have great 
hopes for the lightly mentioned Magic movie. Not that it's going to be the 
greatest movie ever just that it will be entertaining. Hollywood has a lot of
experience recently with making very enjoyable movies from varied geek IP. I
don't see why they can't make something awesome out of a story with all the 
fun fan elements. I mean all I know of Game of Thrones is what I figured out 
from the South Park spoof so I believe it is all about penises, I mean dragons.
Magic has plenty of dragons. We can give the fans lots of dragons. 

If you want a random prediction from me: the story will feature two 
planeswalkers, definitely one male and one female. I'd put my money on Chandra
and guess at Gideon as the male. Jace will only make a cameo hinting at a 
sequel. The plot will be a new planeswalker finding their spark. The plot is 
probably the easiest guess.
