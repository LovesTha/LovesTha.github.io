Some of the guys at my church are producing a silly little series called Robo_Guy_, its a great little mystery/comedy about a guy who's, wait for it, a guy. Its very funny and well put together, even if they're personally staring in it and using quite cheap equipment.

Actually I'll revise that, its very funny.

Anyway, very soon they are having an opening night for the release of the DVD of the first season, it contains 6 short episodes, and is well worth owning. You can all come along to the opening night of it by following the instructions and further detail contained in [this flyer.](http://members.optusnet.com.au/~cerberos2/flyer.jpg)
