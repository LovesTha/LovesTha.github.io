Been reading about some decks for States this weekend, not that I should be as I'm judging. The current best deck appears to me to be Solar Pox as seen at SCG this last weekend. Mainly I love it as it has my favourite card currently in standard: Haakon. The thing I'm most indignant about is that someone else worked out the best combo in standard with it: Court Hussar.

Any way I hope to see you all at States on Saturday.

NB: the entire staff this Saturday has leveled up this year (unless someones judging that I don't know about)
