I'm sort of sure its a good idea to put several large fat creatures into a deck, when they cost 5 or less mana and you have several good efficient ways of getting around there drawbacks available.




Firstly the fatties:  

**Hunted Troll** - 2GG  

Creature - Troll Warrior (R)  

When Hunted Troll comes into play, put four 1/1 blue faerie tokens with flying into play under the control of target opponent.  

G: Regenerate Hunted Troll.  

8/4




**Hunted Dragon** - 3RR  

Creature - Dragon (R)  

Flying, haste  

When Hunted Dragon comes into play, put three 2/2 white Knight creature tokens with first strike into play under target opponent's control.  

6/6




The ways to fully capitalise on the under costed fatties:  

O-Naginata  

Loxodon Warhammer




The ways to get around the drawbacks:  

Pyroclasm  

Jiwari, the Earth Aflame  (also a decent dude who appreciates a O-Naginata or a Loxodon Warhammer)  

Yamabushi's Storm (only kills the faeries, not the knights)  

Wildfires (also kills the Troll, but he has regenerate)




So a rough decklist:  

8 Forest  

8 Mountain  

4 Karpulsan Forest  

4 Tendo Ice Bridge (will have to wait for a later set for uber Ravnica duals)




4 Hunted Troll  

4 Hunted Dragon




4 O-Naginata  

2 Loxodon Warhammer




4 Pyroclasm  

4 Jiwari, the Earth Aflame  

2 Wildfires




4 Gnarled Mass  

4 Birds of Paradise  

4 Naturalize




The sideboard of this deck is calling out for what ever RG burn/destruction spell gets printed.
