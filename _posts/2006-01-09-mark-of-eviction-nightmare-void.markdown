This pair of cards seams to be a fairly hellish combo for your opponents. Obviously the idea is to continually bounce your opponents creatures and force them to be discarded. Filling the deck with more discard would seam like a decent idea to try and deal with more troublesome permanents, and to give you something to force the discarding of when they didn't top deck a creature. Drain life for the win would probably be the play as well
