Friday:

GPT#1: Lost in first round :(

GPT#2: Lost in first round :(

Saturday:
GP Melbourne Round 1: Won against Pink Weenie
GP Melbourne Round 2: Won against really really bad draws from a Goblin deck
GP Melbourne Round 3: Lost against BGA
GP Melbourne Round 4: Won against control Tog (traditional Tog + Life from the Loam engine)
GP Melbourne Round 5: Lost against control Tog (ditto)
GP Melbourne Round 6: Lost against Affinity
GP Melbourne Round 7: Lost against JikiKiki.dec because I'm a F@#$%^& newb.

Sunday:
PTQ Honolulu Round 1: Lost to Rbg Goblins
PTQ Honolulu Round 2: Lost to ICan'tRemember.dec
PTQ Honolulu Round 3: Beat Septer Cant
PTQ Honolulu Round 4: Beat Affinity (piloted by: I'll keep dropping artifact land with a Deed on the table)
PTQ Honolulu Round 5: Lost to Madness (after stealing a win by having Brawn to trample over a (very) Arrogant Wurm with a Jitte+2)

So 0-2 in GPT's, 3-4 in GP, 2-3 in PTQ for a grand total of 5-9 for the weekend, so I wonder how low my constructed rating can get now?

More details to follow as I get time
