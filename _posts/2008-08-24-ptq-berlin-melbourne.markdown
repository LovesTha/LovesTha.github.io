Using the deck I had success with last weekend I went into the PTQ confident of a respectable win. After making several changes to last weeks sideboard, but none to the main deck this is what I played:

**Sideboard:
**1 [Cloudthresher

2 [Shriekmaw

](http://www.magiccards.info/query.php?cardname=Soul+Snuffers)2 Wispmare
1 Wickerbough Elder
2 Snakeform
2 Puppeter Clique

This sideboard was much better than the list from Denver. I managed to finish the tournament at 5-1-1 with my loss in the swiss coming to Faeries weilded by Will Chan.

The top 8 consisted of:
Chan - Faeries
Charles - Faeries
Chifley - Faeries
Gareth - Assfolk
Juzza - Doran
Jezza - Kithkin
Scott - Doran
Dwaine - Quillspike

My quarter final was against Charles Koh, his first hand would have blown Doran's 2 drop opening hand out of the water but I had the tree folk opening so I won reasonably quickly. The second game Charles kept a hand that just needed to draw a coloured mana source, he didn't so he lost. I did give him only 4 draw steps to find the mana source so I advanced to the Semi.

Unfortunately, I was destined to play the winner of the Faerie miror, and I lost in two very dominate games. So the three Faerie decks I played on the day were the three in the top 8 and managed 3-4 in games against them. So I was pretty happy with my result to be honest.
