I was enthralled to hear that Eleven people working on a gag for the Chasers War on Everything/APEC had been arrested and charged in Sydney. They had set-up 3 black vehicles, 2 SUVs and a Limo, to look like a motorcade for the Canadian president. Their impersonation wasn't all that complex, some flags on front of the Limo and some security guards. Their 'Insecurity Passes" were very fake, ever second phrase on them declared their fakeness.

This simple ruse managed to get them into the exclusion zone far enough to be within a quoted 10m from the hotel the US President is staying. This has gotten the eleven charged with: "entering a restricted area without justification". Police had waved them through the check point and they had turned around of their own accord when they reached the perimeter of what they believed was the exclusion zone. They were only intercepted when heading away from the hotel the actor dressed as Osama Bin Laden got out of the car.<!-- more -->

Now for the conspiracy theory, created by my devious mind. I find it hard to believe that the security in Sydney is this lax currently. The more plausible story to me is that they knowingly let the Chaser team into the zone so they could later arrest them. They knew they didn't pose a credible security risk so they were safe to let it, while being closely monitored. Then they arrested them before they managed to get away with it.

The quote about being 10m from the hotel has been revised to 1 block, I didn't realise Sydney was such a small town :)
