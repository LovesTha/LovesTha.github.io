Played in 2 Coldsnap event this weekend at [The Games Village](http://thegamesvillage.com.au/). The one I Friday night I messed up by adding a small splash (4 cards) into the deck. This was a mistake, colour consistency is too important, and I was already running 2 [Mouths of Ronom](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&id=121234) so it gave me 4 off colour lands, which is much too inconsistent.

Sunday I played in the next sneakpeek as well at TGV, this was much better, I still splashed a 3rd colour for some extra removal, but didn't have the extra colourless lands or the many double coloured costs. From memory I only lost 1 game in the 3 rounds, winning all the others quiet easily as my deck was very aggressive.

Unfortunately I'm considered too much apart of TGV to actually be awarded the major prize of the DVD player for winning :(
