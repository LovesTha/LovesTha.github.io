I just changed from a pair of 19" CRT monitors at work to a single20" wide-screen LCD. I am loving the added desktop space, but the drop in screen space is annoying. I was using 1 19" CRT and the LCD for a short while, but the terribly mismatched pixel sizes and colours pissed me off much to quickly.

Trying to make better use of screen real estate I have now undocked the sub windows from the Borland Builder windows. Which to my great surprise has fixed how it interacts with focus follows mouse. I am a huge fan of focus follows mouse as I love to look at one document while typing in another. Also the ability to go hours without clicking the mouse while multi-tasking is fantastic.

Borland Builder though has always ignored the focus follows mouse setting of "raise on focus" and raised it self instantly. But now that I have undocked its sub windows it is sitting patiently in the background when it gets focus and doesn't raise it self till clicked.

This does make me very happy.
