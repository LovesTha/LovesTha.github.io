I finally went 2-1 in a draft. It was the first time I had in 10 drafts, of those 10 drafts I went 1-2 8 times and 0-3 once, the other one was a 1+1,1 (getting a bye in the second round).

The point of this post though was to bitch and moan about my favourite card store dropping its prize payout structure for its drafts from 2-1-1-1 to 2-1-1. This has started people drawing the final round as one of the players may be playing for all or nothing. I think this un acceptable as IDing at small local events is not very friendly. With so many people drawing the final of the draft makes it much harder for the rest of us to get a booster prize, as when you go 2-1, you only have a 50% chance of getting a prize, where in the past you were guaranteed a prize.

Now I'm not the best player around, but I've tried to always go 2-1 at drafts, and I probably go 2-1 slightly more often than I go 1-2 (although I go 0-3 much more often than I go 3-0). When I go 2-1 it tends to be loosing one of the first 2 rounds, not the finals, so I wont have the chance to ID into 2-0-1 and guaranteed prizes. So in effect this change has halved my expectation of a prize in drafts.

Pretty much all the cards I get are through drafting (and the occasional continuous draft at my second favourite store) and prereleases. This makes me rather annoyed as now I am essentially paying more than I did before for product. :(
