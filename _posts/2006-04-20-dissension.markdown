I'm unsure what my feeelings are about this current rumour season. Its barely 36 hours away from the start of the Melbourne prerelease and the MTG Salvation Rumour Mill is sitting at 116/180 cards. This feels realy strange, we all typicaly exspect the spoiler to be much fuller by this stage of the season.

Now I'm divided on if I should keep looking at the leaks and go to the prerelease not knowing the full text of every card. I wonder if it would cause me to have more fun?
