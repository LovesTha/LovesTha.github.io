Couldn't find all the cards I needed for the white version of the rock above, so I had to:

-3 Mortify
+2 Faith's Fetters
+1 Last Gasp
-3  Birds
-4 Dark  Confidant
+4 Civic Wayfinder
+3 Nezumi Graverobber

And the mana base was far from optimal without birds and only 7 relivant shock lands. So I managed to go a lousy 1-2 against the feild last night :(

I'm starting to think that the red option might be more aggressive, even if it has less ways to deal with a Glare of Subdual.
