Ok, its not so much Christmas as summer. Why do people think that they need to stop things for the holidays. Sure you might have a few less people turning up, but *news flash* a few less people isn't the end of the world.

Summer ends up being my least favourite time of year purely due to the lack of things to do. Or maybe that just that I haven't done much this weekend :(

PS: this is in no way an attack on the Christian side of Christmas, as that is 100% fantastic.
