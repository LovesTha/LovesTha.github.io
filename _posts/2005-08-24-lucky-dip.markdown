I un-equivocally love this format, sure I suck at it but I'll put that down to me being a good player and therefore someone at a disadvantage the more random the format.

So why do I love a format that I suck at?  Who wouldn't love a format where you can seal the game with a Lumbering Satyr sitting next to a Flailing Ogre?
