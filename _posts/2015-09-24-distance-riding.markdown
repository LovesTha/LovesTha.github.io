I've been pushing hard on the fitness side of things the last few weeks. The 
diet has been suffering, but I'm not feeling too bad about the need to snack 
when I'm riding all the time. Last week I managed to commute to work 3 times, 
a total distance of 159km.

I am part way through attempting that again this week. My shoulder has pulled up
very sore after yesterday's ride, so I've called off riding tomorrow. 

Having ridden 464km so far this month and I'm hoping to reach 570km by the end of
the month. 690km is the target for October, although that is forgetting that I'm 
going to miss two commutes due to GP Sydney, so I'll need to make up those rides 
on weekends. 700km will be my monthly target through summer.

The start of this month I picked up a new bike, a [2014 Kona Rove][3]. I have been 
really enjoying riding it. It isn't a bike designed to be ultra fast or light. 
Strength and reliability are much higher on it's list of features. As is the 
option to run wide tyres and mount racks and fenders. That gives me a bike that 
I'll be happy to ride to work regardless of the weather. As only riding on nice 
sunny days doesn't fit around real life or getting enough exercise from 
commuting.

Looking on [Strava][1] and comparing my fastest ride on my older road bike to 
the [first ride][2] on the Rove showed me to be within 1 minute of the same 
time. Considering that is 75 minutes of active cycling a single minute slower 
counts as measurement noise to me. Your ideas may be different to mine, but that 
is why there are a thousand other bikes on the market.

One of the surprising things about buying this bike has been just how much 
bigger this bike is than my old road bike. I would have assumed that with such a
large difference in size it would have been clear that one or the other was 
enough of a bad fit for me that I would have been getting very sore riding one
or the other. The new bike is more comfortable, but I wouldn't say that the old
felt cramped.

What has quickly become evident is that I need new shoes. The old ones feel too 
big and I could do with a more stable attachment to my bike. The heel is also 
falling out of the sole which can't help either.
