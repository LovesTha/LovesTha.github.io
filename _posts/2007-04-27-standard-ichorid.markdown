I know there's a problem with naming a deck after a card that isn't in the deck, but I think the name works.

Obvious inclusions:

Narcomeoba
Nether Shadow
Bridge from Below

Golgari Grave Troll
Stinkweed Imp

Sindbad
Magus of the Bazaar

What I can't see is how to capitalise on the engine, Vintage Ichorid has Sutured Ghoul to reanimate, and while we do have Dread Return, just nothing to return. Do we just attempt to capitalise on the dredge mechanic and play Zur's Weirding and Angels?

I need some ideas people.
