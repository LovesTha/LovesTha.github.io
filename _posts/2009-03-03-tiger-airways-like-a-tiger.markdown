So I decided it was time to buy tickets to Canberra for nationals, Tiger Airways ended up being the cheapest option. So I purchased the tickets online. $101 for a return trip to Canberra is pretty good in my eyes and that's after selecting to have some check in luggage and selecting which seat I wanted on the way there.

So everything was sweet until I noticed the price charged to me on the ticket confirmation, $111. Apparently they manage to charge you $10 more for 'convenience', I'm not sure yet what convenience they are charging me this fee for, but that's a later part of the story.

Not wanting to look like a fool I go through the booking screens again doing a text search for this extra fee, it is never mentioned once on any of the pages. In the interest of doing things the same the second time through I attempt to select the same seat again. No worries mate, but that is a worry to me: How can I book the same seat on the same flight twice?

Do I even have a booking, I don't need to resolve this immediately, nationals isn't until July, but there's no time like the present. So I give the local Tiger call centre a call (tip: they have no local numbers, just the direct normal number for Melbourne, which is fine for those who live in Melbourne . . .)

The next problem though is actually getting to talk to someone. Their number is busy 5 out of 6 tries and when you get through and select an option at the prompt: Silence followed by disconnection.

I would really like to talk to someone.
