I hope all of you had a great Christmas day and enjoyed the company of friends and/or family. I hope you weren't too busy too think about the reason for the season (my favourite silly phrase for Christmas) and about some of those with less opportunity to enjoy the day than you have.

To one and all, enjoy the break.
