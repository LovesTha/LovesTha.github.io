I <3 The Dresden Dolls. The Red Paintings also don't suck.

I went to the DD concert last night at the Corner Hotel, we managed to get the long end of the stick by missing out on tickets for the first night as we had 0 keyboard issues, compared to the first night where they were abundant.

I was completely impressed with the sideshows that were put on and the 1.5 support acts were very good as well. I really like it when the main act does the encore with the support acts, DD seam to really want to support music and performing arts in general.

Anyway I can't wait till they come out to Australia again
