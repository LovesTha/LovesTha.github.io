Today Wizards announced the full detail of what is happening with Coldsnap. It's going to be long lost third set to Iceage block. Its going to get the full curent treatment, fatpack, theme decks etc.

I think it will be realy interesting to see what cards they put into the theme decks, as its a chance for Wizards to re-release some highly sort after cards like Force of Will and um foily Forces of Will. I think it will be well worth ordering 4 copies of the blue theme decks just incase the have Forces in them, as new bordered Forces will be a very hot item if they can only be found in theme decks.

I realy hope that they don't put Force of Will into a theme deck though as it would do terrible things to the price of the old ones, it won't increase the number of T1 decks running force, just the number of them that are available. But even if they do release them it'll only set Forces price back 3 years, which is no biggie
