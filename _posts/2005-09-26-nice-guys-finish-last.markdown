Played in the Two Headed Giant event at our (Melbourne) prerelease yesterday. It was a lot of fun, but was a bit tedious playing with someone as green as my team mate (second time playing magic ever). First round we lost with about 3 or 4 minutes on the clock. Second round we drew during extra turns. Third round we won during turn 4 of extra time. Round 4 we managed to win in around 30 minutes. Fifth round we lost in like 20 minutes. Pretty slow for as far as I'm concerned.




In the first game we won though their occurred a situation where it could be aledged that I was a bit of an asshole. Our opponent made a move to react to our declaration of attacker, so I stopped them and asked were they doing this during the declare blockers step, they replied "Yes" and proceeded to cast Flash Conscription and try and block with the creature they stole. When I informed them that it was too late to block they were quiet indigent. I was right it was too late to block:

Was I too harsh? Should I have given them the chance to do things as they intended? I don't think so as they had gained more information that they should have had at the point at which they meant to cast Flash Conscription and the misplay was done due to a ignorance of the rules, not sloppiness. Then as the petty player that I am, I wouldn't let them take it back as he relay annoys me (half the reason that I draft at a particular store is so I can beat him, the other half is the easy pickings for rares I need)
