Due to the request of Scott I feel I need to continue my long running posts of burger reviews.

On the Saturday that is now referred to as Black Saturday I went down to Mornington for a swim with a friend. We decided to stop at La Monicas on Main Street in Mornington, it was such a hot day that we decided to eat inside and were thankful for the water that was served regularly.

Both of us decided to order the burger because it sounded really good: Steak, Bacon and Mushrooms on a Turkish style bun, served with salad. The prospect of Mushrooms wasn't all that inspiring, but it sounded pretty good.

When the burger arrived I was fairly disappointed, but first the good. The meat used appeared to be reasonably high quality beef, with essentially no gristle/fat and it tasted fantastic. The bacon was also of good quality.

The Turkish bun, which encouraged me to purchase the burger in the first place wasn't toasted. Which was a substantial problem because the mushrooms had been cooked in plenty of butter, making the whole burger nearly too soggy to hold.

Lastly you'll notice that my list of ingredients for the burger didn't include letuce or tomato, so the first thing both of us did was add them from the side salad to the burger.
