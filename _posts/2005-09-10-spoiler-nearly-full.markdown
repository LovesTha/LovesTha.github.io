Just reminding people that MTGSalvation.com's Ravnica spoiler is nearing completion and is very good reading now.




With some of the cards that have shown up on the spoiler I've made a few untested changes to BF.dec I've added 4 of these beasties:




**Trophy Hunter** - 2G  

Creature - Human Archer (U)  

1G: Trophy Hunter deals 1 damage to target creature with flying.  

Whenever a creature with flying dealt damage by Trophy Hunter this turn is put into a graveyard, put a +1/+1 counter on Trophy Hunter.  

2/3




He's replaced the Gnarled Masses for two reasons. Firstly he's easier to cast with the single G in the cost and he doubles as an answer to Hunted Trolls Flyers. Increasing the number of creatures with power




**Fist of Ironwood** - 1G  

Enchantment - Aura (C)  

Enchant Creature  

When Fist of Ironwood comes into play, put 2 1/1 green saproling creature tokens into play.  

Enchanted creature has trample




Just trying out 2 of them to see how they go. With the increased numbers of ways to deal with the tokens I give my opponents I decided that I could cut Wildfires, which has always seamed sub par in play testing. So I replaced the with the new Wall of Blossoms: Carven Caryatid, which you should all know by now since it showed up on MTG.com. I have a sneaking suspicion that this little dynamo is going to end up as a 4 of in nearly every heavy green deck.
