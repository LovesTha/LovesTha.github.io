Today I listened to [Freakonomics'][1] podcast interviewing [Anne-Marie 
Slaughter][2]. The topic was ['Meet The Woman Who Said Women Can't Have It 
All][3]. It was pretty clear that she is on a publicity tour for her new book,
[Unfinished Business: Women Men Work Family][4] (affiliate link), but that
doesn't make her a bad person. Everyone is free to attempt to make a profit from
their hard work, I can only presume that writing a book is a lot of hard work.

The podcast started with attempting to dismiss some of the myths around Anne-
Marie's now imfamous The Atlantic article ["Why Women Can't Have It All"][5]. 
That article goes into depth on the realities facing women trying to balance a 
healthy home life with a high profile professional carrer. It highlights that 
for such a balance to exist a women must have significant control over their
work hours, it can't work when a workplace is inflexible. In the interest of 
full disclosure: I have only read the first third of that article, so I'm not 
sure if the article leads onto or merely leaves open the option of the 
following topic.

The second half of the podcast focused on the even less popular idea that 
further advances in womens rights will come from reconditioning men. Apparently
her [new book][4]
