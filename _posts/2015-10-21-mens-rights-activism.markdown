Today I listened to [Freakonomics'][1] podcast interviewing [Anne-Marie 
Slaughter][2]. The topic was ['Meet The Woman Who Said Women Can't Have It 
All][3]. It was pretty clear that she is on a publicity tour for her new book,
[Unfinished Business: Women Men Work Family][4] (affiliate link), but that
doesn't make her a bad person. Everyone is free to attempt to make a profit from
their hard work, I can only presume that writing a book is a lot of hard work.

The podcast started with attempting to dismiss some of the myths around Anne-
Marie's now imfamous The Atlantic article ["Why Women Can't Have It All"][5]. 
That article goes into depth on the realities facing women trying to balance a 
healthy home life with a high profile professional carrer. It highlights that 
for such a balance to exist a women must have significant control over their
work hours, it can't work when a workplace is inflexible. In the interest of 
full disclosure: I have only read the first third of that article, so I'm not 
sure if the article leads onto or merely leaves open the option of the 
following topic.

The second half of the podcast focused on the even less popular idea that 
further advances in womens rights will come from reconditioning men. Apparently
her [new book][4] goes into detail on how the focus on allowing women to 'have
it all' is both unfair to men and not going to become rea through that focus. To
give women a realistic oportunity to 'have it all' the culture around work/life
balance needs to change in workplaces and the wider community. To get that 
change it isn't just that men need to be coerced into joining the fight, they 
too need to reap the benefits.

Why shouldn't men too be invited to 'have it all'? Please, please, please don't
get me wrong: I am not saying men have it tough. We have huge swaths of life 
realy easy. That doesn't mean we have all options available to us. Society (yes
the one we've collectively created for our selves) pushed men towards relatively 
few options in life.

Anne-Marie had a really great observation about how child rearing has changed in
the past century. Each of the past four generations has brought up it's daughters 
with vastly different expectations to the way they were brought up. Daughters are 
told that they can be what ever they want to be, the whole world is their oyster.
Where they were once taught that the only way to be a successful woman was to get
married and raise children they now are given the option to do that or have a 
career.

The only thing that has changed in the way sons are raised is that now there is
an emphasis on making them more respectful. That might be changing a little bit
more with the next generation, TV shows like Modern Family are starting to have
more stay at home fathers. Untill those shows default to having 'workaholic,
absent father' as the go to comedy stereotype in the same way they currently use
'stay at home mother' because of it's obvert, although over emphasized, 
anacrhonism.

## Swinging Pendulums

Hopefully the swinging pendulums are moving us towards a utopian future. Where
the expectionations for adults were firmly women will be the care giver and the
men the provider the womens pendulum is clearly moving. 

It is reasonably clear to me that is has moved past the nuetral position and is 
currently pointing slightly to the provider side. There are signs that a
woman is more likely to be shamed today for choosing to be a stay at home mother
with little career ambition than those who completely fob off their child 
raising to a nanny. I fear that the pendulum may still be swinging further to 
the provider side, but hopefully it will reach neutral in the next two or three
generations.

Movement in the male pendulum has been close to invisible so far. The majority 
of the movement to date has merely removed the stigma from fathers who show 
enjoyment in raising their children. There has been very little reduction in the
expectation for them to be the provider. The most that I can accept is that they
are allowed to conceede that their partner earns as much as they do.
