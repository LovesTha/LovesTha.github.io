I really dislike ads. I also hate bloated applications. So it is quite a pitty that MSN Messenger (Live) is such a useful app. Those adds and videos that constantly grab my attention in the corner of my screen really annoy me.

Naturaly someone has taken the hard work out of removing the adds. So if you use A-Patch you can get you contact list to look like this:

Which is much much better. What is slightly weird is that A-Patch is being used as an evangelistic tool for the Muslim faith. I'm not exsactly sure if I think that software is a good tool for such purposes, but its not over the top or annoying so go ahead and download the appropriate version for your messenger and enjoy a much more streamlined option.
