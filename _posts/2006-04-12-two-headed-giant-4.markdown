Well its in the books now, sort of. Firstly it not really in the books as we failed to actually run it, only 3 teams turned up and the minimum number of teams for a teams tournament in 4. And secondly its not in the books in that the DCI site doesn't seam to want to let me cancel the event now.

The 6 players that we had along, 5 members of the Brown family and their honary Brown: Jonathon, played a fun 6 player draft. It was fun to play but fairly uneventful.

This seams to show that tournaments will slide in attendance from one prerelease to the next, so here's for hoping the next one will be much larger, I need to off load some cards :).
