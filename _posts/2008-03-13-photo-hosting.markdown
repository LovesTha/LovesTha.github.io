I'm about to start putting pictures into my posts about my holiday. Should I just be using Wordpress hosting for them or should I use a third party?

Any opinions peoples?

For reference this is what a Wordpress hosted image will look like:

Hrm, it appears that only smaller images can I use a thumbnail for :( So suggestions are needed.
