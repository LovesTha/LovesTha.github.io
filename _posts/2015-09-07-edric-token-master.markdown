A new [Commander league][2] started this evening at [Next Level Games Ringwood]
[3]. After coming third in the previous league I wanted to play a couple of new
decks in this league.

I'd been thinking about a deck centered around tokens. Looking through a list
of [token ideas for commander][4] I decided that [Edric, Spymaster of Trest][5] 
was my immediate favourite. Every time I've stumbled on Edric has made me think
about building a deck with him.

A general that fills both the role of rattle snake, something that when on the 
table makes people want to attack other players instead of you, and of refilling 
your own hand has appealed greatly to me. That his hand refilling is much much 
stronger when going wide with tokens made this a strong choice for my token 
deck. That and I really wanted to have green in the deck.

Once I put together the list I wanted to build I found I need to acqurie a few 
cards. To be particular I needed these:

Citanul Hierophants
Nemata, Grove Guardian
Parallel Evolution
Saproling Symbiosis
Slate of Ancestry
Spontaneous Generation

Which I rushed over to [Puca Trade][7], have you checked out my [series on 
using Puca Trade][8], and added them to my want list and they were all quickly
on their way to me.
