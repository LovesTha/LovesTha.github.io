I saw this quote on IRC today:

3:52 DealerButton: oh is it thanksgiving this week?
3:52 Aussienomancer: .....
3:52 nmu55: yeah today
3:52 Adept_Enivid: Yes, today. In some countries
3:52 Adept_Enivid: Or perhaps only USA, I don't know.

How little do you need to know about thanksgiving to not understand that it is a US only holiday. Sort of like how only America celebrates the American Independence day.

It makes you wonder some times.
