Just letting it be known that I am hosting a day of EDH on Saturday the 15th of December. It'll be at my new place starting at 11.00am. Please let me know if your thinking of turning up, I'm sure you can think of a way to contact me. All correspondence that mentions that they need my address will receive my address. If you need to contemplate public transport I live nearly as close to Rosanna station as is humanly possible (ok, there are a dozen houses closer, but thats close right)
