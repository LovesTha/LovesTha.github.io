Damn, that was an exhausting weekend. Not that I did more than I have at previous prereleases, but I think I'm less fit now and a bit sick :(

Saturday was a lot of fun. Everyone seamed to enjoy the set and there was a good turn out, somewhere around 330 participations. Sunday I got to play in the 2HG which was a lot of fun, we went 2-2-1. It probably would have been better if we had of opened all of the boosters instead of opening one of them as the pairing were being posted.

The most memorable part of it though was a judge call: Player B has played a Morph, then Player A has done some stuff (or maybe this was in the other order, I'm not 100% sure). Team AB tries to end the turn Player C and D tap a total of 4 Slivers to Mill Player B for 4 cards. After that resolves Player B attempts to unmorph the creature to discover that it is a suspend creature and promptly calls a Judge. Judge calls Head Judge, who then proceeds to involve pretty much every Judge in the room in the call.

At the time they eventually decide that the creature stays in play as a morphed creature that can never unmorph (Proc Error - Major - Warning). Later after discussion with other high level judges the Head Judge advises people on a judge discussion forum that it should have been Proc Error - Severe - Game Loss.

I was player B :(
