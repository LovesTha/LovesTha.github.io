Here we are now in our new WordPress site, doesn't it look good.

I'm really liking it over here in WordPress land, everything just seams to be so much less annoying.  The whole interface is so much cleaner, modern and easy to use.

Please excuse the tweaking that will continue for the next few days.

In more relevant news I'm planning on adding more content to this site in the next few weeks. I'm hoping to put together a small team of people to try and test decks for regionals as I really want to qualify this year.
