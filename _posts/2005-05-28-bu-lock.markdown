Ok here's the list:  

4x Skull Collector  

2x Crystal Shard  

4x Aether Vial  

3x Fabricate  

4x Chittering Rats  

4x Ravenous Rats  

4x Distress  

4x Nezumi Shortfang  

3x Kiku's Whisper




4x tendo's Icebridge  

4x Salt Marsh  

4x Island  

1x Minamo, School at Water's Edge  

1x Shizo, Death's Storehouse  

10x Swamp




SB?




Perfect Combo Opening:  

Turn 1: Swamp, Eather Vial  

Turn 2: Vial counters = 1, Swamp, Nezumi Shortfang  

Turn 3: Vial counters = 2, Swamp, Skull Collector, Vial in Ravenous Rats  

Turn 4: Vial counters - 3 & bounce Ravenous Rats, Swamp, Ravenous Rats, Activate Shortfang, Vial in Chittering Rats, at appropriate time (ours or their turn)




Opponent only ever sees 11 cards and we win on the back of damage from Stabwhisker the Odious (don't flip him in response to their draw step, only flip him when they fail to discard, making them discard the top card of their library makes them see a 12th card)




So is this any good? I have no idea, haven't even played it on MWS yet and it is a 3 card combo, but it does run at least 6 and as many as 8 copies of each combo piece. Common give me your thourghts, I know no-one is reading but I'll keep pretending someone's out there.
