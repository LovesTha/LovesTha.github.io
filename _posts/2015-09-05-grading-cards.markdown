This instalment of the [Puca Trade series][5] covers the details of grading 
cards for [Puca Trade][1]. I'm going to point you to the best resources I've 
found for describing what a near mint (NM) card is and isn't. Then I'm going 
to discuss how to deal with cards that aren't near mint.

# Pages describing card conditions

## [ABU Games - Detailed Magic the Gathering Cards Condition Guide][10]

ABU Games has the most extensive guide to card conditions. For each condition
they have three or more cards with both front and back images accompanied by a
detailed description of why the card has gained the condition listed.

This is the best resource I've found for learning how to grade cards.

## [Star City Games - Card Conditions][6]

Star City Games provides a useful page that has images describing features of 
cards at each grading level. Their photos give plenty of detail showing the 
issues. They are the best reference to help a home trader learn the different
card conditions.

## [Black Border - Card Conditions][9]

Black Border have used the same card for all their card conditions, making it
easy to see the difference. They have only one example for each level and their
description isn't detailed enough to help a home trader learn what should be 
called what.

### [TCG Player - Magic the Gathering: Card Condition Guide][7]

TCG Player give less examples of things that cause a card to be slightly played
(SP). There photos are of a high quality.

### [Card Kingdom - Grading Guide][8]

Card Kingdom use a different scale to other stores. There second best grade is
EX, which corresponds with other sources definition of slightly played. Using
different names doesn't change what they are calling less than NM though. They
only have photos of the back of cards and just a single one for each condition.

# Puca Trade Policies

[Puca Trade][1] are very strict on their card conditions. The policy forbids 
sending a card that is less than near mint. Nonetheless many people are happy to
receive cards that are slightly played. 

Firstly check their profile page to see if they have clarified their position on
cards that are not near mint. Many publicly state that they are never willing to 
receive cards that are not near mint. With those receivers you must quickly 
cancel the trade and there will be little consequence. If you ignore this and 
send any way it is likely that you'll be paying for shipping back to you or 
negotiating a new value with no bargaining power.

If they clearly state that they are happy to receive any card that is slightly 
played it still isn't safe to blindly send them slightly played cards. The best
cause of action is to send them a message with photos of the cards to confirm
that they believe the cards are only slightly played. People don't always agree
on what condition a card is but if they disagree you can be put in an 
uncomfortable position.

Once they confirm that the condition is acceptable then go ahead and send. Be
careful with protecting cards in the mail. More detail on that will be in a 
later [post in this series][6].

When you receive cards it is important to check cards for condition. That is as
long as you care about the condition of cards you receive. It is possible to 
resolve things without opening a dispute, but I recommend opening one straight
away. While it might offend the sender they have already offended you by sending
cards that weren't acceptable. 

There are two common results from reporting cards not in the correct condition:
sending the cards back; or receiving a partial refund. Personally I tend to want
a partial refund as card condition isn't that important to me.

While I've had few instances where I've needed to use the dispute resolution, 
when I have it has been quick, efficient and clear. It has given me great 
confidence in continuing to use the service.

In the next part of this series I'll go over some methods for sending cards 
safely. Please subscribe to the [RSS feed][4] if you would like to know the 
moment the next in the series is posted.
