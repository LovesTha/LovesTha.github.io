In my 13 years of constantly playing Magic I have never played in a League. 
I've played in nearly every other tournament, the two biggest I can't recall 
doing is a Rochester Draft and I haven't played on the Pro Tour. On Sunday my
local store, [Next Level Games Ringwood][1] is starting up a [three week sealed
league][2]. 

I'm not a master of sealed but I'm wanting to play a bit more and visit the 
store more regularly so a league is perfect. It will really help me try and
enter the local community better, I haven't done much socialising with this
group of players yet.


In fact it's so perfect that I'm going to going another league in 2 weeks time: 
[NLGR's Commander League][3]. That one will be lots of fun as well, I've got 
quite a few decks lying around that I've played less than 2 games with each.

One I did really enjoy playing the 2 times I've brought it out is my [Titania,
Protector of Argoth deck][4]. I've put many mono green Commander decks 
together, but this is the first that has been really fun to play. That might be
due to it being a list I ripped from some source that I forget online, but it
is a pretty straight forward version of the deck. It has a pretty simple plan,
based entirely around trying to use the generals abilities to their fullest:

1) Get lots of lands into play.

2) Get Titania into play.

3) Have lots of lands die.

4) If someone wraths, repeat.

It isn't a particularly complex deck and mono green has plenty of redundancy on 
all of the effects the deck wants to it is quiet reliable. Looking at that list 
there are a couple of obvious cards to include from Origins, but I suspect that 
will take a couple of weeks to happen for me.
