I manged to 3-0 a draft at Card Heaven last night. It was slightly better than that though, I managed to 6-0 my games. The biggest surprise was that there was 2 shock lands in the rare pool. I was expecting that when I finally managed to win a CH draft that I would have 0 decent rares to pick from.

When I get home I'm going to place that deck in the sleeves used in a deck box and leave it on the shelf for prosperity. And i don't really know what that word means :)
