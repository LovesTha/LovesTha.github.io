I was sitting at the computer trying to remember who had won the Northern Magic Championship 2006, our first ever annual championship. Then I remember that I had submitted the results via email so I had a copy in the sent emails folder on gmail (due to the timezone issue fixed in the newer version of DCIR). So after some quick reading of the XML, not the worlds hardest to read format, I'm proud to announce that team Browns won the DCI Vampiric Tutor.

Team Browns was made up by two of our more regular attenders Ron and Daniel Brown. There unstoppable combination of [Rimescale Dragon](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&id=121184) AND [Rimefeather Owl](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&id=122116) stomped all the other teams into submission. All the other teams put in a good showing although some common courtesy could be improved on by some teams.

Most importantly everyone had a good time :)
