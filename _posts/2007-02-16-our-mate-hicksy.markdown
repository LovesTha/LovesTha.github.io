I can't understand what type of evil David Hicks is meant to be, from a [current ABC article](http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200702/s1849401.htm):


"He allegedly personally collected intelligence on the US Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, and was trained in covert photography, the use of dead drops and the use of disguises.




The charge sheet also alleges Hicks later armed himself with 300 rounds of ammunition as he prepared to fight against coalition forces at the Kandahar airport."


People receiving training in the methods of espionage usually don't arm themselves with 300 rounds to attack trained armed forces at a major location like Kandahar airport. Either you get trained on how to attack a building or on how to infiltrate and drop a bomb.

I guess the other possibility is that the 'terrorist' are so badly organised that they can't even figure out how to train their own people. If so, what are we so worried about?

Or are our own forces just as badly trained?
