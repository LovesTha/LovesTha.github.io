I think it's time for me to mention my all time second most common place to eat at (behind at home and it recently passed my university's food hall for most meals eaten): Alphabet City Café.

I've eaten here weekly for the past 11 years, with a few short breaks when my congregation has flirted with other venues. At the end of each of those flirts I've been very happy to return to the trusted old friend ABC Café. It is a great warm welcoming place. The staff is very friendly and they all have authentic flair, none of that forced flair that we all remember from that awesome movie that escapes my memory right now.

My favourite meal is the Chicken Oscar, a decadent chicken schnitzel topped with crispy bacon, avocado, hollandaise sauce and melted cheese. In all its extreme artery clogging power it is a delicious dish served with chips and salad. It featured on the specials board 4 or 5 years ago, and we just kept ordering it for the next year till they finally put it on the menu.

My other favourites include the Lara's Fav salad, which is surprisingly filling, and many of the common items on the specials board like the ribs and various pies.

I really don't understand their low rating, it's probably from people looking for something less interesting or more up market. They are well worth a try for a casual meal.
