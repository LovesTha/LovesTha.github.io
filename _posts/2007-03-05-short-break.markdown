We had 5 teams along on Saturday and a fun time was had by all for most of the time.

I'm posting this up to let people know that next month the first Saturday is during the Easter long weekend, for which I'm heading up to Toowoomba for a Christian Music Festival. Naturally this means that I wont be running a 2HG that weekend, I recommend that everyone gets away for a bit of a holiday them selves. As the weeks either side of it I have family appointments I can't move the event either, so the next NM2HG will be the 5th of May.
