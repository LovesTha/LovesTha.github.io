Dan of Dan's Data recently posted an article about [Genetic Modification of 
Humans](http://www.dansdata.com/gz078.htm). While its not the most informative 
piece, at least for those who understand genetics in at least a high school 
way, it does have several good links and provokes some interesting thoughts.

What would you change about your self if you could wave a magic wand? The 
first things I would change would be purely physical. Convince my body to not 
store more than 1% fat, in the modern western world we have no need for fat 
reserves. I wouldn't do anything about my physical appearance beyond getting a 
perfectly healthy body, although I probably would reverse a bit of hair loss.

Such small (or large) changes would be good but we really haven't changed 
anything other than my life expectancy yet, which I assume should be in the 
high 100's once technology like this becomes available. What I would really like 
to change about my self is to get at artistic things. Yes I know I write a blog, 
but I don't do that because I think people will be entertained by my prose. It's 
a personal expression thing: I write because it helps me think. Also I think that 
some of my posts would be helpful to people, I do occasionally post something 
worth finding in a search engine.

Now I wouldn't want to be the next huge thing in art. Just someone who could make 
a decent living doing something artistic 30 hours a week. I would cope with 40 or 
50 hours if it was enough fun though :)

Sitting around waiting for genetic therapies to make your life idyllic isn't a good 
idea though, as I'll probably die before they start to be covered under normal 
health care plans. I have been enjoying the work of several people around the world 
where they remove the borders, like these following images:

There's a lot of very good looking art in those. Although some are better than 
others. One question is how playable are these cards. If care is taken while 
painting to ensure that the cards thickness doesn't change they aren't any more 
marked than a foil card is (which isn't the same things as saying they aren't marked).

From all the reading I have done of the relevant DCI documents, I have only found one 
relevant clause: Artistic modifications and signatures are acceptable if they don't 
make the cards art hard to recognise (paraphrased, but if the specific wording is 
important to you: A) you're pushing things to far and B) you can find it for your self). 
The other relevant thing is a [O] net rep ruling from roughly 2004 stating that a cards 
title is what defines which card it is (it is relevant to cards that are badly miscut, 
but the concept can be applied a bit more broadly. So when I start doing these 
modifications I will always do two things:
	
  * Not modify the cards art, except for some subtle blending at the edges to make my 
	art feel more natural
	
  * Leave the card name alone.

As a judge I would have no problem with a player using any of the above cards in a 
sanctioned tournament. I would remind any player using such cards that anything beyond 
a mint card could be risky as different judges will rule differently. I would suspect 
that many other judges would find the cards that remove game relevant text to be illegal 
though, so your millage may vary.

I  probably wont make any cards that go as far as the Pyroclasm and Terramorphic Expanse
though for a very long time. That is just a matter of skill though, my skills currently 
are non-existent, so I suspect it will be a long time before I feel comfortable enough to 
add large blocks of original art.

Once I return from India the purchasing of some art supplies will be need to be done.
