My Email:

_I am trying to buy tickets to The Gossip show, but the payment page with the
national isn't loading. How can I buy tickets? _

Their reply:

_Tickets $38.00 + booking fee from Polyester, Missing Link, Greville, Central
Station, Prince of Wales public bar (12 noon - 10pm, 7 days), phone book 03
9536 1168 (credit card only, 10am - 6pm Mon - Fri) or **book online here**!_

Well done on getting a 0 for your comprehension skills.

PS: emphasis mine.
