The event went off yesterday with about as little hassle as could be imagined.  10 teams ended up playing in the event, when 10.00 rolled past 2 teams were unaccounted for out of the 11 pre-registrations, with some of the teams having people get word to me that they weren't going to turn up, but with those slots easily filled by people who just turned up. The 10th team turned up 10 minutes into deck construction, which was no issue.

I only got 2 or 3 rules questions the whole event, one being a Boros Fury Shield question about a double striking creature and how much damage would be dealt to the controller (it pretty clearly says it does damage equal to the creatures power, which obviously happens at the same time as the spell resolves Mr Saturday School). Another one of the rules questions was about what exactly 'you' refered to on a card, although I suspect that question was a test as it was coming from a judge who seamed to have some idea about the rules of Two Headed Giant.

All up we sold off the remaining product at cost price (that sure got snapped up fast, people like boosters at $4 each, even when they're only 9th ed), leaving us with a small amount of money to give the church for the use of the facilities. The profit might just help ease the tention of destroying the monitor I borrowed out of the office, huge arcs within the case when plugging it into the wall is not a good thingâ„¢.

The Y fundraising of selling food also did well and raised ~$80 which is nice, although none of the members of that congregation actually turned up to help out :(.  But that rant doesn't belong here.

All up a great event and I can't wait to plan another.
