Ubuntu killed my computer

I installed the new version, 6.06, of Ubuntu last weekend. After lots of playing around I manged to get XGL and Compiz working, all nice and pretty. On Saturday night this weekend I was about to start playing with the settings for Compiz to make it a lot less annoying (I like graphics effects, but after about a week I like to turn them down to barely noticeable) when I noticed that Ubuntu wanted to install like 60 odd updates, so I let it and unusually it asked me to reboot to finish them, I guessed this was due to the requested update of the kernel.

On reboot nada. System wouldn't boot, BIOS would even attempt to boot the OS. So after 30 minutes of trying to convince the BIOS to boot the OS I booted from a live CD to discover the problem. To my horror I found that the disk appeared to be un-partitioned!

This did not make me a happy camper.

If any one knows of a way to recreate a partition table from nothing more than a list of the functions of each partition please contact me.
