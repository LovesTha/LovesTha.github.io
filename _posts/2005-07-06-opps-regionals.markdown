I believe that regionals was a few weeks ago.

I also believe that I played in it and came 17th.

Out of 70 odd I believe.

I'm fairly happy with my 4-3 effort. I feel things may have been better for me if I hadn't of lost the first round to a Red/Black pile.dec. I mean who expects such a deck to sideboard how it did.

The situation you see is that he'd pulse of the forged me a few times, so I knew he had it in hand. I also knew that I either wanted to do 1 more damage to him, or enough to kill him on the spot, me having several insect tokens. So I attack with my lethal insect suited up with blanchwood armor and another token, thinking either he terrors the uber insect token or dies, if he has the terror then I do the max 1 damage that I wanted to do if I wasn't to win on the spot.

Naturalise.

Who plays Naturalise in a Red/Black deck when you can only cast it via pendant prisms?

Yes, I know the answer to that is people who beat me in round 1 of regionals.

The heartiest thing to me is that the most 'exciting' point of the day was when i called a judge over to check if my opponents deck was sufficiently randomised. At the end of game 1 my opponent spaced out the mana in his deck evenly (showing me the whole contents) then proceeded to block shuffle several times. So I did the only thing I could in good faith and called the judge telling him "I don't believe my opponent has sufficiently randomised his deck" and we retold the judge what he'd done. Mark then looked through the deck and decided it was shuffled sufficiently. Boy did calling the judge over for this get my fingers tingling.

Naturally I proceeded to smash him in game 2 for the match.
