I've been using the current beta for a few hours now and am loving it. They want to claim that it is up to 3x faster than Firefox 2 at complex web applications, now I can't put a quantative number on it, but it does feel faster.

Yeah I know placebo effect and all that, but it does.

I recomend giving it a look, it can't hurt right :) Linkage.

Hrm, well that would be a link if the link creating window didn't appear to be broken, I wonder what caused that?
