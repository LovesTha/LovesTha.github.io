I read a rather reasonable article on Star City Games yesterday evening, titled "Introduction to Two Headed Giant Draft."  For those that haven't played the format before, or who have played and sucked badly I recommend reading it. It is the top8 format for the upcoming 2HG PTQ.

"The point is that when you're in one of these drafts you have to use a completely differently mindset, and not just automatically take the “best overall cards” with your early picks. The values have changed in most cases in this format, and those who are aware of this have a huge advantage."
