John Howard has announced that the government will spend some money on reducing pollution:

"The Government will increase spending on measures to tackle global warming by $627 million."

and the following is also being reported along side it:

"He says Government will spend $336 million on improving energy efficiency in schools."

From my [quick readings ](http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/07/17/1980126.htm)it appears that the $336million is apart of the $627million, but schools will be able to spend their money on rain water tanks. I'm not sure how much of an effect rain water tanks have on energy efficiency, can anyone tell me?
