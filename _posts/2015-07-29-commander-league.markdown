Monday night I wander down to [Next Level Games Ringwood][1] to play in their 
[Commander League][2]. I played in three pods and had a lot of fun, I'd 
heartily recommend joining up for the remaining weeks if you are even vaguely
interested. Everyone was playing fun decks and were there to enjoy playing,
not griefing.
