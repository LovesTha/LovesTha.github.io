Monday night I wander down to [Next Level Games Ringwood][1] to play in their 
[Commander League][2]. I played in three pods and had a lot of fun, I'd 
heartily recommend joining up for the remaining weeks if you are even vaguely
interested. Everyone was playing fun decks and were there to enjoy playing,
not griefing.

## Pod 1 - Shadowborn Apostle

For my first pod for the night I tried out my Shadowborn Apostle deck, it is
nearly a carbon copy of the [Command Zone list][2]. The biggest change is that
I've added the expensive cards, such as duals and fetches, not because they are
very important to the deck but because I have them.

I got an early Grave Pact which drew immediate heat and I only got a single 
trigger out of it. The game continued from there and eventually I was eliminated
first. The rest of the players were ruing that I no one had a wrath and were
second guessing their decision to kill the grave pact so early.

I never drew a 6th Shadowborn Apostle so the game was big let down. It makes me
want to focus on card draw and wraths a bit heavilier. A straight up wrath would
be really good along with another one or two ways to find skull clamp.
