Monday night I wandered down to [Next Level Games Ringwood][1] to play in their 
[Commander League][2]. I played in three pods and had a lot of fun, I'd 
heartily recommend joining up for the remaining weeks if you are even vaguely
interested. Everyone was playing fun decks and were there to enjoy playing,
not griefing.

## Pod 1 - Shadowborn Apostle

For my first pod for the night I tried out my Shadowborn Apostle deck, it is
nearly a carbon copy of the [Command Zone list][2]. The biggest change is that
I've added the expensive cards, such as duals and fetches, not because they are
very important to the deck but because I have them.

I got an early Grave Pact which drew immediate heat and I only got a single 
trigger out of it. The game continued from there and eventually I was eliminated
first. The rest of the players were ruing that I no one had a wrath and were
second guessing their decision to kill the grave pact so early.

I never drew a 6th Shadowborn Apostle so the game was big let down. It makes me
want to focus on card draw and wraths a bit more. A straight up wrath would
be really good along with another one or two ways to find skull clamp.

## Pod 2 - Titania, Protector of Argoth

In this pod I played what I think is my favourite deck, but I learned a few 
things about how to play it. I built up a small army and used Tooth and Nail to
smash through for enough to kill the poison player. Apparently my actions 
weren't seen as selfless (or the other two players had more to lose trying to
attack each other) and I was taken out next.

## Pod 3 - Tim

This is another list taken mostly from a [Command Zone list][3]. Once again my 
list uses my duals that I have lying around but I've also included the awesome
new Willbreaker from Origins.

This pod had 5 players, which is one more than optimal but we still had fun. It
did drag on a bit though.

My opening hand had the Willbreaker and a Tim so I kept it and tried to have 
some fun. Apparently that wasn't to other players fun so they wrathed. When
I reassembled the combo with a second Tim and Charisma that also needed a wrath.
When I assembled a Tim with Gorgon's Head one of the two elves players decided
that was time to kill me.

The other players really enjoyed the deck though so they gave me enough style 
points that I ended up with the equal greatest number of points in the pod. Which
is pretty good for points as 5 player pods have more points.
