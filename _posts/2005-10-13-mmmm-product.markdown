I currently have in my possession more un-opened product than I ever have before: over 4 displays of it. The biggest problem with it is that I'm not going to get to open much, if any, of it. Around 1/3rd of the people who have told me that they are coming have done so after the official cutoff date, but that is ok so far, because we had only just needed to got to 2 boxes of tourneys and boosters, so now we have room left for just 1 team.

Now all I have to do is actually run the event.
