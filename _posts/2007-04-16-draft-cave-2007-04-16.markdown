People at the Cave have been whining that I don't blog about my drafts there frequently enough. So here is my summery of the draft last night:



	
  * Tried to draft RG storm as Empty the Warrens had been significantly under drafted recently.

	
  * Didn't get any storm cards.

	
  * Did draft a decent RG deck, opening Bogardan Hellkite in pack 2, and getting a second pick Torchling in pack 3.

	
  * Only other notable aspect of the draft was that at the end of pack 1 my playable were extremely lacking, only 6 total.

	
  * During deck construction I still noticed I had few playable, only cut 3 or 4 cards that I'm happy to play (I prefer this number to be up around 10 in a TSP block draft)

	
  * I went 3-0, 6-0 in games, I drew mana and bombs well.

	
  * Picked the Hellkite as my first pick in the rare draft.

	
  * I had a non up-sized Bacon and BBQ Filler Combo for KFC for tea.

	
  * Mountain Dew was my drink of choice.


This is why I don't always blog about a draft, too many drafts are not that interesting to read about. Sure it was enjoyable to play in, but there wasn't anything interesting to report on.
