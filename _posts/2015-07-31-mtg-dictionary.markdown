Today I've just got a short little tip and resource to help make every ones lives a 
little bit easier. Many of us spend a lot of our time writing about Magic, and
it has a distinct vocabulary of it's own. Those of us interested in appearing
to know how to spell insist on doing a spell check before publishing things,
although I'm human and I forget at times. Having a spell check flag on every
third card name makes it much harder to notice the real issues. Particularly
when the real issue is an error in a card name.

What I've done is take the complete oracle text, remove punctuation and generate
a list of the unique words and added them to an aspell personal dictionary. You
can download this dictionary here: [.aspell.en.pws][1]. If you are a linux user
just placing that in your home directory will make your spell checking much less
painful.

For those using other tools the file is just a text file with a word per line. It
shouldn't be too hard to go from that to a custom dictionary for the application of
your choice.
