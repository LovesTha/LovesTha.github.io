Its such a pity when Wizards releases a set that has as little value for tournament players as does Coldsnap. Jeroen Remie's [premium article](http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/12424.html) on Star City Games sums it up quite well, there is only one redeeming feature of Coldsnap, it will only be around for a short while.

One of the local players was complaining to me of how bad Coldsnap is in limited, while I couldn't give him a single reason for why the set was good to play the following things did appease him significantly:<!-- more -->
	
  * Its only going to be the current set for just 2.5 months, not the normal 4.
	
  * Most people are still playing RGD as the main format for drafting .
	
  * Its only going to be used for 1 significant local event, the top8 draft of PTQ Kobe.

Sorry that last point is a subtle lie, it's also the format for my next Two Headed Giant.
