The Northern Magic Two Headed Giant #11 was run this past weekend as a 4 team event, but wasn't sanctioned due to the need for me to play to make up the 8th player. There seams to be something stopping us getting the event sanctioned regularly.

Thing is I think I shouldn't worry about that as I think I'm the only person who is worried about sanctioning. Does anyone agree with that? (I don't think I'd stop sanctioning it unless someone started to get narky about wanting it unsanctioned, I think most people just don't care)
