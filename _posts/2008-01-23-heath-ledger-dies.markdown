In other related news: Father believes son is saint.

I arrived to work this morning to the terrible news that Heath Ledger had been found dead at the foot of his bed. With this news came the information that the room had significant amounts of drugs in it.

That combined with his general good health and being only 28 years old immediately leads to suspicion of un-natural causes and drugs point to an OD. So what does is father come out and do? He declares that his son has died from an accident. I'm not sure how anyone could make such a statement. The police know better and only state the facts.

I wouldn't assume his father would say anything else, but why would the media report such crap?
