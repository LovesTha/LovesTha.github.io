Some of you may have noted that MTGSalvation.com has finished the Ravnica:CoG spoiler.  One of the hottest rares in the set was spoiled in the last rush of information:


<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="400" >
<tbody >
<tr >

<td >**Moonlight Bargain 2BB  

**
</td>

<td align="right" >

</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td >Instant (R)
</td>

<td align="right" >

</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td colspan="2" >Look at the top five cards of your library. For each card, put that card into your graveyard unless you pay 2 life. Then put the rest into your hand.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


Its the black Fact or Fiction, i mean it digs 5 cards deep for just 4 mana.  But will be better in combo decks than FoF as it garantees you the 2 cards you need.  Also its the only decent instant card draw in type2 at the moment!!!
