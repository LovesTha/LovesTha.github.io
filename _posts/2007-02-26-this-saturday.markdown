I got back from spending a few days in Darwin for work on Saturday night, I will assure everyone though that there is very little chance of me moving to Darwin. It is much to humid for me.

Anyway just posting this up to remind people that the [next 2HG](http://rockpaperdynamite.wordpress.com/2007/02/14/northern-magic-two-headed-giant-15/) is fast approaching, the 3rd of March is this Saturday. This might be peoples last chance to practice before the 2HG PTQ that is coming up.

Also if people think that too much 2HG is never enough then get along to the [Caves Standard 2HG](http://shroo.dyndns.org/events.htm) on the same day, but in the evening, well after the Limited will finish.

So please drop me a line if your intending to come so I can have some idea of numbers for product.

PS: Life begins at 30.
