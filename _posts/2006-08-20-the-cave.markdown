The guys over at The Cave, an apparently small venue (I don't think they are quite a store) over in Mt Waverly. I'd love to get over there to join in their Monday night drafts every once in a while, but its really tough for me to get there by 6.00ish.

So heres an idea, if anyone reading this has or can go, could they post a mini review in the comments.
