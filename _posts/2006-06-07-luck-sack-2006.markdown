Last year I was fortunate enough to have my boss pay for my air fares to Canberra for Nationals, all I had to do was pickup a PC from a building in the heart of Canberra. This made me one of the luckiest people at Nationals I'm sure. That is other than WotC employees.

This year I have the good fortunes of being on the Goldcoast for a GPS related conference (GNSS) for some of the week leading up to Nationals, so it was quiet easy to convince them to fly me home via Canberra with a multi-night stay over.

Oh boy its nice to be me.
