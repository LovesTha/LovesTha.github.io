We all have a favourite local games store. Just because it is our favourite and 
we'll defend it against all comers but that doesn't mean that they are perfect.
I've compiled a list of the top reasons I believe most stores are lacking.

Trying to keep things positive I'm going to give two small practicle hints for 
each point of improvement. The first will be if you run a store, the second for
if you are just a fan of that store.

# 1 - Not Enough New Players

When was the last time a new player turned up to FNM and when asked "Can we 
have you DCI number please" they just stare back wondering what foreign language
the scorekeeper is using? If your answer isn't this month, then this is one of 
the ways your store sucks.

As a player the way to tackle this one is a two step process:

* Find a friend who would like to get into Magic and teach them to play.

* When they are ready to play in a FNM or Prerelease take them along. After 
they have played wait a couple of days and ask them about their experience. Let
them finish then ask them what they really think. Then force them to tell them 
what was the worst part of it.

Then take that good quality feedback and let your store know about it.

As a store you know that this is important, it's one of the things you have 
keep doing to maintain your Advanced status (disclaimer: I'm only 90% this is
true, but I heard it somewhere once). If you are finding that it's hard to 
tick this box to satisfy Wizards of the Coast then I recommend really looking
at how to do improve it. Reach out to local communities that are likely to 
have lots of potential players. Hire a stall at a gaming or pop culture event.

# 2 - Not Enough Diversity

Lets do a quick survey, think of all the minorities you can. Now think back to
the last event you were at and try to think if at least 50% of the players were
part of at least one of those minorities. If your minorities aren't in 
combination
