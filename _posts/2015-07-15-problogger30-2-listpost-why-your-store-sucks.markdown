We all have a favourite local games store. Just because it is our favourite and 
we'll defend it against all comers but that doesn't mean that they are perfect.
I've compiled a list of the top reasons I believe most stores are lacking.

Trying to keep things positive I'm going to give two small practicle hints for 
each point of improvement. The first will be if you run a store, the second for
if you are just a fan of that store.

# 1 - Not Enough New Players

When was the last time a new player turned up to FNM and when asked "Can we 
have you DCI number please" they just stare back wondering what foreign language
the scorekeeper is using? If your answer isn't this month, then this is one of 
the ways your store sucks.

As a player the way to tackle this one is a two step process:

* Find a friend who would like to get into Magic and teach them to play.

* When they are ready to play in a FNM or Prerelease take them along. After 
they have played wait a couple of days and ask them about their experience. Let
them finish then ask them what they really think. Then force them to tell them 
what was the worst part of it.

Then take that good quality feedback and let your store know about it.

As a store you know that this is important, it's one of the things you have 
keep doing to maintain your Advanced status (disclaimer: I'm only 90% this is
true, but I heard it somewhere once). If you are finding that it's hard to 
tick this box to satisfy Wizards of the Coast then I recommend really looking
at how to do improve it. Reach out to local communities that are likely to 
have lots of potential players. Hire a stall at a gaming or pop culture event.

# 2 - Facilities

Is the bathroom nicer than an average shopping center public bathroom? Or at 
least on par with with the ones at the nicer shopping centers. How does the 
carpet look? Have the tablecloths been washed this month? Year? People do
have a lot more enjoyment in a nice comfortable place.

As a player this one is pretty simple, but I'm going to sound like you mother.
Push you chair in. Throw out your rubbish. Don't make a mess with your food.
Use the toilet responsibly and flush. Don't lean back on the chairs. Make your
mother proud.

As a store some of the options are expensive but there are important cheap 
options. Yes you can spend a dragon's horde on refurbishing, well everything.
And if you have been earning really good money go ahead and make your store
into a palace to gaming, your players will love it.

Back to the world of normal stores that are stuggling to pay the wages of their 
few staff, pay the bills and hope to have enough left over for the owner to
eat. Here the best thing is to ensure the bathrooms are clean, the tablecloths
have been washed and the floor mopped/vacuumed. Doing this wont make everything
magically as good as a full renovation but people wont have a bad experience
visiting the store. 

It can be good to think about cleaning the bathrooms in the middle of a busy
day. This is doubly true if the toilet is mixed gender.

# 3 - Player Friendlyness

Nothing sours the experience of playing at a store more than having to deal with
an abrasive person. There will always be conflicts of personality in any large
group but the more serious
