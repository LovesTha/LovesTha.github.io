# The Situation

So recently a *thing* happened. Predictably the community reacted badly, but
I think that was sort of predictable. I'm unsure how avoidable it was, and
as I'm not a lawyer I'm not sure how valuable my comentary will be. But I
feel I need to at least write about it. The sanity in publishing it is much
easier to question, but I've never been shy of putting my foot in my mouth.

The cause of the *thing* was that a social media storm errupted about a 
convicted feloon making top 8 of a GP. Some tweeter I've never heard of, I 
don't follow the professional Magic circuit that closely, was tweeting 
links to articles about his criminal past and the Internet was much a 
twitter with outrage.

Later the felon posted to Redit a brief summary of his life since the 
conviction, he wasn't trying to diminish what he'd done, just show that it 
wasn't the start of a trend in his behaviour. It showed that he was working
at being both a good human and to bettering of society.

He didn't go into details about the crime it self, his early plea bargain
coupled with the nature of his crime to give him a short immediate 
custodial sentence (although with work release) with a much more significant 
one delayed. He has passed his bar entrance exam recently and when applying to 
become a member of the bar he only had to declare two minor traffic offences 
in addition to the significant crime that caused this *thing*. While the bar 
hasn't admitted him yet, they didn't knock him back they just deffered their 
decision till they have had more time to think about the situation.

Please don't take anything written here to indicate that I think his crime was 
not really a crime. Not all crimes are equal though, (sane) laws agree and 
allow judges significant discretion in the punishments they can hand out for 
the same basic crime. In my corner of the world Murder can get from life all 
the way down to a minor slap on the wrist (comparitavely). In the lesser legal 
court of Magic cheaters get very different punishments, while they all get 
disquallified from the tournament some receive a sternly worded warning
letter and others receiving lengthy suspensions from the game.

Following the twitter storm there was a small but vocal group of people 
hassling WotC for a response about allowing this player to play in large
events. As his crime was violent towards a woman there were a lot of 
people clammering for his scalp, and they were poking a hot topic right
now. As a community in whole we are trying pretty hard to make Magic a more 
welcoming community for everyone. Even those people who aren't young
white men. Apparently some of those people also have money and deserve to be
able to spend that money on enjoying themselves.

This all lead to the most recent update to the official list of suspended 
players including this criminal. He was given what is effectively a life ban. A
friend of his forwarded to reddit a message explaining how little consultation
happened and that he is going to accept the punishment and look for other 
avenues to pass his time.

# Why Everyone Is Doing What They Are Doing

There are five groups that I've identified around this *thing*.

## The Felon Him Self

He really doesn't have many avenues available to him. Wizards of the Coast do
have the right to limit who participates in their marketing programs (more on 
that below). Taking it in a good natured way (at least in public) is really the
and only way he can try to sway the public opinion towards letting him play.

## The Lynch Mob

Fear of sexual preditors is a very strong emotion. That is a very reasonable 
thing, it's a dispicable crime and those who do it have significant rates of
recidivism. 

Globally and particularly in the USA there has been a trend in recent years to
make the lives of convicted sex criminals harder and harder. They are agendas
pushed with the best interests of victims and the general public in mind. 
Registers and restrictions on where they live is common.

Coupled with the Magic communities push to be more inclusive this is a really 
bad time to have attention drawn to a criminal history that is characterised by
how it attacks one of the minorities that magic has lots of trouble attracting.

## The Jesus Figures

## Wizards' Laywers

## Everyone Else

I thought it important to remind people that this is a *thing* that probably 
most Magic players will never have heard of. Most people just don't pay that 
much attention to organised play.

# Where To From Here

- suspensions are done privately but with due process and appeals processes, they at least talk to them before passing judgement.
