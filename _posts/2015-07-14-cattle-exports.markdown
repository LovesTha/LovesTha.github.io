title: 80% Cut To Cattle Exports

So Indonesia has announced that it is radically reducing it's 
imports of live cattle from Australia. What is puzzling me is 
the news agencies are all reporting that everyone is shocked 
and surprised.

When one of the first, although my memory of these things is 
short and I'd assume that there could have been ones longer 
ago, times that I heard about complaints about the treatment 
of live cattle exported to Indonesia there was a mention that 
Indonesia is trying to ramp up its local production of beef.
It was relevant because they were pointing out that this is 
only a short term problem as the exports were likely to end 
in the foreseeable future.

It is quite natural for a nation to attempt to move more of 
its food chain from import to domestic production. There are
both trade deficit issues and food supply safety issues. When
you import a lot of a type of food a small change in 
production in the country of origin can radically change 
supply to your country. This can be because those producers
will preference local sales over the risk of exporting them.

Is the medias memory really that short? Are the politicians 
really wanting to wait on asking the Indonesians why there 
is a cut? 

Who does it benefit for us to think that the Indonesians are
being petty about our reaction to the execution of the Bali 
drug smugglers? That is the only reason I can see for wanting
to beat this story up.
