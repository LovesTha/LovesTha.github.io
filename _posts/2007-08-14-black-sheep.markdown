I saw Black Sheep last night, it was a Triple J preview screening at Hoyts at Melbourne Central. Firstly can I say that the cinemas there are really good, huge screen and great seats.

The movie started with a quick little promo for Triple J (some animation of tattoos) then it went straight into the movie, I love watching previews, but when we don't have them I love how direct it is. You aren't left distracted by this other kewl movie you'd like to see, I'd much rather have previews as post views.

So finally the movie, the plot and script were great, very funny over all. The acting was spot on. I'm not saying the actors were fantastic, just that they were exactly what was needed. What was also good was the special effects, it takes quite a bit to make people think of sheep as evil, but the did a good job of it.

I highly recommend that everyone see this film, their isn't much horror or gore in it, just a lot of really good laughs.

8/10 for quality.
10/10 for watch-ability.
