Here is the raw dump of my notes from the Forge Intensive this weekend:<!-- more -->

Sun Alan:
memes
Ideavirus
Helenism?

Deb:
Playboy = bad
Cleo = ?
Not concentric circles but inner 2 circles inverted for the male half.

Shirley:
Prayer: Lord, we honestly thank you for the saints amongst us such as Shirley. Give me the strength of conviction to follow Your way as demonstrated by Shirley.
We wail at the void, it does not answer us.
Help us feel Your presence in these difficult times. Without You we are lost.

Tues Bax:
Eph 1:4-6
Free will + universalism. If everyone is saved, can I not choose life?

Alan:
liminality: do we need to try + create it to develop communitas. Or is everyone lives messed up enough already.

Marcus:
How to rest? Is magic rest already?
What does the economy of the kingdom say about ccgs?

Post Reflection:
How much is too much/too little? Do we need to do more than be christians in the community?
PS: I'm not a big one for writing many notes, I will probably come back and discuss some of them over the next few weeks
