On Tuesday night my friendly_ Optus_ Telechoice customer manager rang me to tell me that my iPhone 3G S 16G should be with me possibly on Thursday, maybe Friday. So I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived this morning.

The other good news he gave me on the phone was that Optus will be waiving a months fees due to the slow delivery, this made me much happier and I was looking forward to receiving my iPhone.

A large part of my expectation was that Apple are renowned for things just working out of the box, this was going to be good I thought. So opening the box and digesting the contents two things appear to be missing: Instructions on what to do with my new sim card; And a way to actually use the device.

How is it acceptable to ship such an expensive item with no way in the box to use it. I don't mind uncharged batteries, I'm talking about needing to download a 74M installer for a piece of software that will only work on operating systems that I don't natively use.

Sorry but waiting 15 minutes for my reasonably fast connection to download then install iTunes just so I can use my phone for anything more than emergency phone calls is ludicrous.

This isn't the experience I was expecting.

I was expecting to get to DRM and over the top nannying before getting pissed off at Apple.
