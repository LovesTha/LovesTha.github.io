I've heard a rumour that a tribal event is in the air for the troglodytes, so I need to come up with a deck for it as I got goblins banned with my dirty kitty deck last time. Elves are also banned as someone managed to win with them at the previous tribal event. So the most broken tribe left is humans (actually they are much more broken than elves).

As the cave does have some whiners that dislike people using the best deck they can find I wont be running:<!-- more -->

Naturally I would play around with that mana base to include more legacy legal lands, and replace the Vampiric Tutors with something else. To ease the tensions created by people that only value the Timmy and Johnny side of life I think I'm going to play something more like this:

4x Auriok Salvagers
4x Dark Confidant
1x Disciple of the Vault
4x Trinket Mage
4x Willbender
4x  Voidmage Prodigy
2x Azami, Lady of Scrolls
2x Magus of the Future
25 creatures, 25 Humans, 4 Soldiers,  1 Cleric, 20 Wizards

4x Lion's Eye Diamond
4x Pyrite Spellbomb
1x Pithing Needle
1x Sensei's Diving Top
1x Rushing River
3x Chrome Mox
4x Dark Ritual
18x Other Spells

4x Underground Sea
4x Tundra
3x Flooded Strand
3x Polluted Delta
5x Island
17x Land

Remember the Chrome Moxes + Dark Rituals mean that 17 land is plenty. 8 Morphs that can deal with disruptive spells are going to make things difficult to disrupt.

I might be too greedy on the mana base though, what should I cut for another land or two?
