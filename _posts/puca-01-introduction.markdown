[Puca Trade][2] is the current hottest thing in Magic card trading. Trading 
card games are both *games* and a bunch of cards to *trade*. Hopefully this 
revelation isn't too earth shattering for any of the readers of this blog.
While the game of Magic is very very complex, trading isn't as simple as it
would appear on first blush.

In the early days I believe there was two issues with trading: It was hard to 
find people who played magic and no one knew what cards were worth. The first
was solved as more people go into the game and the second was partially solved
when Scrye was printed as a definitive price guide.

With those two problems out of the way the new restriction on trading was not
finding people who played but finding people who wanted to trade. For a trade
to happen you need to find someone who has a card you want, then they need to
have things they want from you and finally the two of you have to agree on 
values enough to agree to trade and be able to find a trade that both find 
adventageous. Or at least not feel like they are being robbed.

This can be pretty hard to do, personally there are about 15 cards I'm actively
looking for and another thousand I'd be happy to acquire as of today. But out of
the 15 thousand odd cards printed that makes it unlikely that I want anything 
out of the hundred odd cards most people carry in a trade folder.
