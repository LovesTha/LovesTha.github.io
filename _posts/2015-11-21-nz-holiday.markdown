I'm sorry for the lack of recent updates. A holiday in New Zealand with my wife 
is the reason I didn't post for the last two weeks, but there is no good reason 
for the week or two before that. This post is going to diverge from the usual
topics on this blog and briefly mention a few of the highlights from the trip. 
If any of these brief comments inspire any curiosity please ask in the comments
below, I'll try to answer. Really good questions will demand a detailed post in
reply.

There was no particular reason behind this holiday, just that we wanted to go on
a holiday and New Zealand is both cheap and a great place to visit. I had been
on a two week tour of the South Island roughly ten years ago with my sister, it 
was a graduation celebration for both of us, but Lierin had never visited 
Hobbiton before. Since my first trip I've also been to Auckland a half dozen or
more times and visited Rotorua. I wasn't particularly interested in going to the 
North Island.

We flew into Wellington on the red eye from Melbourne. This was one of my first
red eye flights and I was surprised how much sleep we managed. With New Zealand
being East of Melbourne the red eye is in the bad direction for jet lag, making
our first day in New Zealand hard to remember through the sleepyness.





The closest to a Lord of the Rings related activity we did was when I went to 
the toilet at Christchurch Airport it was clearly built by hobbits. The toilet
paper dispensers were mounted so low it was very hard to get paper out of them.
