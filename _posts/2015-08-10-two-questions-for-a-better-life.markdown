I was listening to one of Tim Ferriss's recent podcast, this one he was 
interviewing a video game researcher and entrepenuer, and she had a tip of two
important questions to help anyone live a significantly and measureably better
life. 

I'm pretty sure they are more effective if you don't know the second question
when you answer the first, so I'm going to split them into two posts. The
second will be tomorrow, so don't get lazy about answering the first. You
could just answer pirvate
