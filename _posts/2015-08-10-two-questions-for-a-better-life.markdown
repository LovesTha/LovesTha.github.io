I was listening to one of Tim Ferriss's recent podcast, this one he was 
interviewing a video game researcher and entrepreneur, and she had a tip of two
important questions to help anyone live a significantly and measurably better
life. 

I'm pretty sure they are more effective if you don't know the second question
when you answer the first, so I'm going to split them into two posts. The
second will be tomorrow, so don't get lazy about answering the first. You
could just answer privately in your own head, but it is much more fun to answer
in the comments blow.

Now onto today's question:

# What game do you play the most?

We might need a definition of game here. I mean some activity that you do just for
fun and that you either attempt to do better than someone else or could fail at. The
two most classic examples of those to categories would be chess and solitaire 
respectively, the common more contemporary ones would be Words with Friends and Candy-
Crush Saga. Some of the least intuitive ones would be trying to save more money than
your partner and trying to pick the shortest line at the supermarket.
