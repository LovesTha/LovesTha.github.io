A quote from the man of steel reminded me of something Tim Costello said at Black Stump, firstly Howards quote:





'_Mr Howard says Australia has to obliterate state borders when it comes to water supply.
"At the end of the day we are Australians before anything else,"_' from the [ABC News Page](http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200610/s1763970.htm)


And Tim's quote:<!-- more -->





'_A while ago I was at a meeting in Indonesia with several high ranking Australian officials (Foreign Minister, Head of Armed forces, etc)  one of these officials hand balled a series of questions from the then Indonesian President on to me:
"Would you say that Bush and Howard consider them selves  strongly Christian?"
"Yes"
"Would it be true that a Christian should consider matters of faith to be of prime importance?"
"Yes" - getting a sinking feeling about this line of questioning
"So it must be the Christian agenda to wag war on the eastern world/Muslims?"
"No that is a matter of politics"_' from the recollections of Gareth Pye listening to Tim Costello at Black Stump (heavily paraphrased, although significant attempts have been made to keep to the heart of the story)


Obviously the two leading examples of Christians in the world (Howard and Bush) consider several concepts to be more important than Christianity. Namely: Nationalism and Security.




Can we continue to support our leaders while condemning the likes of Osama Bin Laden and his ilk, when they are all just as wrong on their concept of what their religions calls for?
