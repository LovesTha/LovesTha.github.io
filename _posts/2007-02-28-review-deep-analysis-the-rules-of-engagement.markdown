I just spent the last 10 minutes of my lunch break reading _[Deep Analysis - The Rules of Engagement](http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/13763.html)_, by Richard Feldman. Don't go running off to read that link unless you've read this review first and have a SCG premium account.

The article isn't that bad. He makes some useful insights into the decisions one had to go through to decide what deck to play in Mirrodin block constructed. Then moves onto the current Extended PTQ season. Nothing revolutionary is mentioned about deck choices for the current season, and he freely admits that he doesn't have any good way to choose a deck for it.

The only rule he can give is that currently you need to ensure you choose a deck with enough abstract power to beat the random decks. Abstract power in the sense that a 'Tog is always powerful, but Destructive Flow is only powerful if the opponent is slow and has non basics, so 'Tog is the abstractly powerful card. This rule isn't all that insightful.

He concludes with (paraphrased) "I don't really know how to set up any rules for choosing decks for the current Extended PTQ season. I hope this article helps you choose your deck for the current Extended PTQ season."

What a load of crap.
