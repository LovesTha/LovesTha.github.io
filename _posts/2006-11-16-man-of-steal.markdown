A great quote from of Prime Man today:

_"It's critical that society's contemporary attitudes be reflected in our legislative standards on marriage and family"_ - [ABC news](http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200611/s1789964.htm)

Unfortunately the Iron Giant is referring to reform about the rights of a man who is paying child support to get access to DNA tests to ensure that he is paying for his child. That's a right that I can support, but I would love for him to go well beyond that and remove from our laws the 'Christian' sense of family and allow for a much less discriminatory set.
