I was just watching the local varient of what I am sure is a very common format around the world: Encourage people to send in mode videos to win a large prize and viewers get to vote on what is the best video. There is always the same scam that all but the 3 videos you get to vote on are random collections of funny videos from similar shows all around the world, why bother making more original content that you have to, just ensure you continue to be classed as the required local content. Such a bad excuse for TV.

What got me wondering tonight was why do they fuzz out the logos of the companies they sourced the videos from. It doesn't make sense. If they want to not show who they get the videos from why can't they get the unbranded videos? If there sources are insistant on keeping the branding then why aren't they suppling the videos with a contract that requires visibility of the logo?

That only leaves the option that they are obtaining the videos in some illegal way. That doesn't sound plausible for such a large enterprise though. What gives?
