So I'm heading over to Austin in just over a month to judge at the Pro Tour. So its time to start preparing for the event. So its time to build a current EDH deck. Ok that's only part of the things I need to do.

I also need to plan flights around the US, accommodation for holiday, car hire, visa.

Oh and yeah, I might look at some rules documents and judge a few local events to get fully up to speed on the life and times of Magic.

So anyway and EDH deck eh? I've been thinking that Uril would make the most sensible choice for my next EDH deck as it probably does what I wanted Godo to do, but in a more fun and less repetitive way. And with the recent release of Planechase I think I need to build the deck with a planechase deck in mind as I'd expect some planechasing EDH to happen.<!-- more -->

So I've been looking around for ideas about what directions to take the Uril deck. The main option appears to be do you include the enchantress draw engines or not. So lets link to two useful examples.

With Enchantress: http://forum.dragonhighlander.net/EDH_Forum/viewtopic.php?t=1853

Without Enchantress: http://forum.dragonhighlander.net/EDH_Forum/viewtopic.php?t=1762

While the Enchantress route looks predictable, it also looks fun as you have all these Enchantress effects (4):
Argothian Enchantress
Enchantress's Presence
Mesa Enchantress
Verduran Enchantress

Plus a whole bunch of enchantment tutors (5):
Enlightened Tutor
Idyllic Tutor
Sterling Grove
Academy Rector
Three Dreams

Next would be the sick enchantment returners (3):
Open the Vaults
Replenish
Retether

And then the normal ones (3):
Dowsing Shaman
Eternal Witness
Nomad Mythmaker

So now we want to abuse Uril, so we need ways of making him larger and evasive. Flying isn't the best evasion, fear would be better but isn't available to us and neither is unblock-ability. Trample is pretty good if Uril has grown large enough.

So that's where the deck list sits currently. Now I need to put it together and try it out locally a few times before Austin. GP Melbourne will give me a definite chance to give it a work out but I'll be heading for the US straight after it so I wont have much time.

Here follows what I think the plane deck will look like for it:

Agyrem
Plane -- Ravnica
Whenever a white creature is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, return it to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step.
Whenever a nonwhite creature is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, return it to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step.
Whenever you roll C, creatures can't attack you until a player planeswalks.

Bant
Plane -- Alara
All creatures have exalted.
Whenever you roll C, put a divinity counter on target green, white, or blue creature. That creature is indestructible as long as it has a divinity counter on it.

Eloren Wilds
Plane -- Shandalar
Whenever a player taps a permanent for mana, that player adds one mana to his or her mana pool of any type that permanent produced.
Whenever you roll C, target player can't cast spells until a player planeswalks.

Feeding Grounds
Plane -- Muraganda
Red spells cost 1 less to cast.
Green spells cost 1 less to cast.
Whenever you roll C, put X +1/+1 counters on target creature, where X is that creature's converted mana cost.

Naya
Plane -- Alara
You may play any number of additional lands on each of your turns.
Whenever you roll C, target red, green, or white creature you control gets +1/+1 until end of turn for each land you control.

Pools of Becoming
Plane -- Bolas's Meditation Realm
At the beginning of your end step, put the cards in your hand on the bottom of your library in any order, then draw that many cards.
Whenever you roll C, reveal the top three cards of your planar deck. Each of the revealed cards' C abilities triggers. Then put the revealed cards on the bottom of your planar deck in any order.

Shiv
Plane -- Dominaria
All creatures have "R: This creature gets +1/+0 until end of turn."
Whenever you roll C, put a 5/5 red Dragon creature token with flying onto the battlefield.

Sokenzan
Plane -- Kamigawa
All creatures get +1/+1 and have haste.
Whenever you roll C, untap all creatures that attacked this turn. After this main phase, there is an additional combat phase followed by an additional main phase.

Stronghold Furnace
Plane -- Rath
If a source would deal damage to a creature or player, it deals double that damage to that creature or player instead.
Whenever you roll C, Stronghold Furnace deals 1 damage to target creature or player.

Tazeem
Plane -- Zendikar
Creatures can't block.
Whenever you roll C, draw a card for each land you control.

Undercity Reaches
Plane -- Ravnica
Whenever a creature deals combat damage to a player, its controller may draw a card.
Whenever you roll C, you have no maximum hand size for the rest of the game.
