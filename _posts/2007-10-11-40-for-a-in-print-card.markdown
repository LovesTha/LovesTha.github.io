A favourite ebay seller of mine, kidicarus, who appears to be a mtgo botter who redeems sets to then sell as individual cards on ebay, just sold a play set of Tarmogoyfs for 160 US dollars. That has to be the highest cost an inprint card has gone for.

I pity the fools who didn't get a play set early.
