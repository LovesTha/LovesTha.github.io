God must have been unhappy with me looking towards other saviors this weekend, as I went abysmally at the pre-release. Sure I averaged 4 packs of prizes per flight I entered which implies that I went 2-2 in each, but really I went 2-5 +bye across the 2 individual flights and 2-2 +bye in the team flight (as did my team). I managed to pickup 4 packs in each of the individual flights due to prize sharing 2 of the rounds that I lost.




I definitely have to blame my poor deck building in each of the flights for my poor performance. I was trying to push for what made my decks powerful at the Betrayers pre-release (where I went 13-3, with 2 of the losses being against Jittes and the third being when I was playing a silly deck, think Genju of the Realm on turn 4 silly, it did happen). With betrayers I believe what made my decks powerful was the amount of spirit/arcane interations that I managed to fit into a single deck. With Saviors I was consistantly loosing to decks that didn't have as much synergy as mine, but they just had more powerful cards.




Once playing around with things at home I found a few different color combinations that I could have used that would have given me more powerful decks by ignoreing the synergies (or at least the blatant ones that Wizards hands out to scrubs) and just using the most powerful cards I had available.




My question is now though: Was I lucky at the Betrayers pre-release and just managed to avoid the real decks in most of the rounds, or was Betrayers significantly different to Saviors in what qualities a deck should have? Thing is I wont be able to see any of the pros view on this as Champions + Saviors is not a 'real' format :(
