No one really wants to play Elder Dragon Highlander with a mono coloured deck (rumours of people who enjoy Karn as a general not withstanding), So I'm going to start on the 2 colour options first.

But why start with an enemy pair? Probably because I believe it has the legend I want to use for my next deck :)

Onto the list:

Ghost Council of Orzhova WWBB
Legendary Creature -- Spirit Lord
4/4.
When Ghost Council of Orzhova comes into play, target opponent loses 1 life and you gain 1 life.
1, Sacrifice a creature: Remove Ghost Council of Orzhova from the game. Return it to play under its owner's control at end of turn.

First up alphabetically is the card I want to build around. Its got a tough casting cost, especially in a enemy colour pair, but you do get a good sized body to go with it. Also it is very resilient so it shouldn't ramp up in cost too much over the course of a game.<!-- more -->

What I think this card has going for it is that it encourages the deck to play into the strengths of the two colours, so the deck will have a lot of internal synergy. Lots of reanimation, something that Black and White are both good at. Maybe a token theme trying to get lots of creatures to sacrifice, Endrek Sahr, Master Breeder here I come.

Selenia, Dark Angel 3WB
Legendary Creature -- Angel
3/3.
Flying
Pay 2 life: Return Selenia, Dark Angel to its owner's hand.

Not much to see here, but it is a flying option, more likely just a creature to put into a normal deck.

Teysa, Orzhov Scion 1WB
Legendary Creature -- Human Advisor
2/3.
Sacrifice three white creatures: Remove target creature from the game.
Whenever another black creature you control is put into a graveyard from play, put a 1/1 white Spirit creature token with flying into play.

Another solid option, encourages a large commitment to creatures, and creatures of both colours. Very useful ability too, removing creatures from the game is very useful. I think this would lead to a strong but not very interesting deck.
