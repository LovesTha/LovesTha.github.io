After speaking to some lecturers at uni about their homosexual tendencies (they need me to comeback over summer to do 1 more subject before I graduate), I dropped past some random building in the city to pick up some Deeds and an Overgrown Tomb to finish of my deck, which looked somewhat like this:
**
*Main Deck***
4  Polluted Delta
1  Bloodstained Mire
3  Watery Grave
4  Overgrown Tomb
1  Lonely Sandbar
2  Cephalid Coliseum
3  Barren Moor
2  Island
1  Forest
1  Swamp
22 land

4  Psychatog
4  Wild Mongrel
4  Golgari Grave-Troll
1  Genesis
1  Brawn
1  Wonder
15 creatures

4  Circular Logic
4  Deep Analysis
2  Sensei's Divining Top
2  Life from the Loam
1  Gifts Ungiven
3  Darkblast
3  Echoing Truth
2  Chrome Mox
2  Careful Study
23 other spells

***Sideboard***
1  Darkblast
2  Ray of Revelation
3  Cranial Extraction
3  Duress
3  Pernicious Deed
3  Putrefy
15 sideboard cards

Which is 3 cards off of Craig Jones' deck from PT:LA the weekend before. I liked his deck as it looked like a lot of fun, but thought that the raw power of Cephalid coliseum in the deck was much to powerful to ignore. Also I felt that 3 Life from the Loam was too many as I was never using it as a draw engine in the early game, and by the late game I'd always dredge ~15 cards so there was always 2 of them available for dredging.
Friday was very slow at GP:Melbourne, it was something like 1.00pm before the first trial even started.
In the first round I got paired against some weenie deck that I had too take too much early damage against to manage to win a game.
Then once that trial got around to the semi-finals (or maybe even the final) the second trial started up.
In the first round of this trial I got paired against one of the younger regulars at CardHeaven playing Heartbeat combo. Game one I lost after messing up how to play around moments peace, and then I lost game 2 in spectacular fashion. I'd kept a hand with nothing but blue mana sources, but with a careful study or two, but had only managed to draw into a second blue source and a SDT by something like turn 5. My opponent decides that he needs to go for it on his next turn and drops a Heartbeat of Spring and gives me another turn. At eot I have a look at the top 3 and see: Overgrown Tomb; Psychatog; and Cranial Extraction. So naturally being the idiot that I am I put the Tog on top with the land under it and do some top tricks on my turn to bury the top and play the Tog. After ending my turn I sit back and let Rob (the judge hanging over this game as were coming close to time) make sure my opponent doesn't cheat/screw up.
Obviously he manages to combo out that turn and I loose, if I had of instead decided that casting Cranial Extraction against combo players was the tech he wouldn't have been able to win and gg to me. Instead I had to hope for him to randomly fizzle which he was better/luckier than to loose that way.
