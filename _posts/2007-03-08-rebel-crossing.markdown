Its been a while since I've built a deck in a post, but I'm starting to think about the next constructed PTQ (yes I know its a long way off but its good to start thinking early) which is block constructed (yes I know there is another set to be released before the PTQ but its good to know the formats evolution). The first deck I want to try and build is Rebels:

Core (8):
4 Amrou Scout
4 Blightspeaker<!-- more -->

Good Targets (20):
4 Aven Riftwatcher (great dude, even better with Dust Elemental)
4 Big Game Hunter (theres always big dude that needs killing)
4 Knight of the Holy Nimbus (hard to kill dudes are great, specialy with a wrath in block)
4 Saltfield Recluse (excellent combo with Porphyry Nodes)
4 Amrou Seekers (efficient evasion, although not as hot as the Riftwatchers, a watch this space, soon to change)

Silver Bullet Targets (3):
1 Rathi Trapper (removes dudes that BGH can't)
1 Zealot il-Vec (repeatedly removes small dudes)
1 Dunerider Outlaw (good in green matchup)

Gas (7):
3 Dust Elemental
4 Porphyry Nodes

Land (22):
4 Terramorphic Exspanse
4 Flagstones of Trokair
4 Swamp
10 Plains

Sideboard:
4 Enslave (I want that Tefferi (although he doesn't hurt this deck))
3 Dunerider Outlaw (I'm sure the Green Haste Agro will be popular)
4 Sunlance
4 Voidstone Gargoyle (must be randomly useful I'm sure)

The deck obviously needs a few less dudes and some more tricks but I think it might work. I think I need to play it a few times to figure out what dude can be removed for tricks, the Seekers don't look very good compared to the rest. I'm also unsure if the deck should run black for Blightspeakers or stick white with Defiant Vanguard, but I think Big Game Hunter answers that question.
