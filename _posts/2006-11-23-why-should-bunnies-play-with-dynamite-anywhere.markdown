Quite often I notice that people find my blog when searching for "where bunnys shouldnt play with dynamite". This causes me two huge issues:



	
  1. Why are people searching for this string?

	
  2. Why am I the top 2 responses for it?


I mean what is peoples fascination with bunnys and dynamite? Sure its bit of a funny concept, but that's not enough of a good reason.
