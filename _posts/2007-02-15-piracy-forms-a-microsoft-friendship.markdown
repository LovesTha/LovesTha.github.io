I know this is slightly old news, but I just stumbled on it again and I love it.

The Romain president told Bill Gates at a Vista launch do,      "Piracy helped the young generation discover computers. It set off the development of the IT industry in Romania."

Following that up with: "It helped Romanians improve their creative capacity in the IT industry, which has become famous around the world ... Ten years ago, it was an investment in Romania's friendship with Microsoft and with Bill Gates."

This has to be one of the classic conversations in history :)
