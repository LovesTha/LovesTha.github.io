I won't buy a MacBook because they don't come with 2 mouse buttons (I don't like to plug in mice, and I use Linux >90% of the time), but some people want you to not buy them because they aren't green.

[Apple Ad Spoof](http://www.greenpeace.org/apple/ads)

Nice to know that Dell (7/10, second best on scale) rates much better than Apple (2.7/10, worst on scale) on the [Greenpeace scale](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/toxics/electronics/copy-of-how-the-companies-line).

Buy green, buy a PC (from dell).

Also buy your phone from Nokia.
