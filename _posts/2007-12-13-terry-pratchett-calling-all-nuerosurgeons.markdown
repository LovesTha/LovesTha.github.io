Terry Pratchett has announced on the his artists [web site](http://www.paulkidby.com/news/index.html) that he has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

Apparently he feels that there is plenty of time left for him to write a few more books, and would only life offers of help "from very high-end   experts in brain                          chemistry".

I hope the next few books are just as great. In other news an author has been selected to write the final [Wheel of Time novel](http://www.brandonsanderson.com/blog/585/Brandon-to-Finish-Wheel-of-Time).
