Follow this little logic arc with me:



	
  * Organisers of the BDO (Large music festival in Australia AND NEW ZEALAND) decided that because of the inappropriate use (inciting violence against people who wouldn't show appropriate levels of patriotism, really why wouldn't you want to kiss some strangers Australian flag?) of the Australian flag at last years festivals to ban the possession of flags this year

	
  * Large public outcry about people not being allowed to take Australian Flags (some claiming on Australia Day, there is no BDO on Australia day this year)

	
  * Little Johnny speaks out about peoples right to use the Australian flag, without any possibility that some people were using it incorrectly.


Does this mean that John supports the thugs who went around bashing people who didn't comply with their requests towards the flag?
