I learnt many things while judging nationals. The most important things are though the answer to some of the questions that were asked.

This doesn't mean that my answers to rules situation were enlightening, it would be more true to say that other peoples answers to those questions were more useful. Its the questions about what I want from judging and levelling that gave me the biggest.<!-- more -->
At the start of my Kaleo Team membership I was asked I was trying to do. In the great spirit of aiming for the stars I answered "determine what it would mean to be chaplain to the Pro Tour." While I would accept a job as chaplain to the PT, I don't think its what I'm currently actively pursuing. The current task that is before me is the building of a strong christian community within the Melbourne magic scene.

To form such a community I feel it is needed that I be an upstanding member of the community. One easy way to do that is to be a well respected judge who is active in the local scene. I feel that to be a well respected judge I need to gain experience with judging that is most efficiently gained while judging high level events, things like Nats and GP's. I don't think its required that I become a level 2 judge, in 2 or 3 years time I'll have a good look at the type of jobs I'm doing with my judging and determine if that reflect the roles of a L2 or just an L1.

Part of this realisation was that while I knew that attaining L2 wasn't about knowing the right answers it was about doing the things a L2 does. I still had the horse and the cart in the wrong order, I was trying to do the things a L2 does so that I could become an L2. Now I more wholly grok that you test for L2 so you have official recognition that you have been behaving as one. Its the concept of a reward for what your doing not a prize to make you do those things.

In summery Nats taught me:
	
  * What it means to be a good judge (L1)
	
  * What it means to be a L2
	
  * Something of what it means to be a L3 (a lot of the difference from L2 to L3 seam to be much more subtle)
	
  * What I want from judging
	
  * What I can give judging/magic

So here's for me judging GP Sydney, I hope to gain there the remainder of what I need to be the judge I want to be for the near future. (No I don't entertain the concept that I will know everything I need to know then, the world constantly grows)
