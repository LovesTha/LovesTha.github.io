On Friday (just after I left for the long weekend away), [](http://forum.mtgmelb.com/profile.aspx?f=4&p=7)Dale Aitken posted the list of judges accepted for judging Australian Nationals. This excites me a lot. The opportunity to judge at such an significant event excites me in a way that is hard to describe.

Firstly its great because it means its going to be a very busy few days. Work is flying me to the Gold Coast for the [IGNSS ](http://www.ignss.org/conf2006/index.php)[Symposium.](http://www.ignss.org/conf2006/index.php)  This is going to be my conference I'm going to attend in a professional manner.  I've been to the [AGDC](http://www.agdc.com.au/) as a LANer and spent a little bit of time listening to a few of the speakers as the were talking about a few interesting things.  Also I've been to several christian conferences on different topics, but I imagine they are quiet different to a conference on GPS.  Heck, whats the difference between a 'symposium' and a 'conference'?

I'm going to be leaving the IGNSS Symposium early to fly straight to Canberra, work is also paying for this flight and the flight home on Monday. This is going to make it one very cheap weekend, I'll have to pay for a taxi ride or two and a few meals here and there, but that's it.

All that and I get to judge Nationals, this all sounds too good to be true, I wonder whats going to go wrong.
