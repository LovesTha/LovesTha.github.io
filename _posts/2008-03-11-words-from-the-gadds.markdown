I don't commonly post links to articles on magic sites, but this one is worthy of the linkage. Some (very few) were complaining about the way the Melbourne preleases were run, so one of the important players from the region posted this article as a response. One of the paragraphs is worth quoting though:

"Things happen at pre-releases that aren’t as frequent at higher          level events. Firstly, there are a lot of mistakes made by players due          to the cards being new and unfamiliar. This presents an opportunity for          players to become more accustomed to calling judges and more importantly,          to gain experience at interacting with judges. Don’t try and resolve          issues that come up yourself; it’s a bad habit and will only get          you in trouble at other events. When you call the judge over, you will          get a chance to gain knowledge about the rulings process and how to relate          your side of situations in a credible way. I see people get the short          end of the stick in tournaments all the time because they were either          confused about whether they should have called a judge in the first place,          or unable to relate their questions to a judge in such a way to get the          information or ruling that they needed. If you are playing in your normal          tournament area, calling a judge can have the additional bonus of giving          the judge experience in answering questions, which means that if they          happen to be judging the next PTQ in your area, you will be more likely          to receive a correct and fair ruling from them."
