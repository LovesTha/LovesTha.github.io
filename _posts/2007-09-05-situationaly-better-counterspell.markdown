**Maneuver of the Demon** - UU
Instant (U)
As an additional cost to play Maneuver of the Demon, return a creature you control to owner's hand.
Counter target spell.

It is meant to be a card previewed in a Japanese Magic magazine. I can believe that its a card that would see print. I'm also sure that it makes Jamie Wakefield sad. It is going to be very not fun playing against this breed of UG decks. I feel like a deck list:

4x Maneuver of the Demon
4x Mystic Snake
4x Venser, Shaper Savant<!-- more -->
4x Delay
4x Wall of Roots
4x Mind Stone
4x Think
4x Think Twice
3x Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir
2x Draining Welk

4x Terramorphic Expanse
4x Yavimaya Coast
10x Island
5x Forest

I am sure that deck will be very annoying to play against. The only 8 cards causing you to tap mana on your own turn are the mana accelerators.

Lorwyn sure is looking like fun.

Look at the top three cards of your library. You may put them back in any order or shuffle your library.
Draw a card.
