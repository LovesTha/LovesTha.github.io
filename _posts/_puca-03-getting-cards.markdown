Getting cards with [Puca Trade][1] is the pain free bit, but it has dangers. As
it is a purely push system things can happen very quickly, even while you sleep.

When I first signed up to [Puca Trade][1] I used the import option to import my
want list from [Deckbox][2]. I'd been using Deckbox for a long time and had a 
literal bucket load of cards in my wants list. Many of them were random cheap 
old cards from early sets that people very rarely have for trade. They'd been on 
my want list for months or even years and occasionally one would get added to a 
trade to help balance out the prices and I'd be happy to have another weird card
in a commmander deck. It was all good.

It was all good because sometimes I'd start up a trade and find that some cards 
were suggested that were for decks I was no longer building. Sometimes I'd get 
them anyway as I'd use them eventually and I wasn't really losing anything; the 
value they contributed to the trade was minimal and the trade would happen with
two happy people wether the card was in the trade or not.

This is different on [Puca Trade][1], when someone sends you four random old 
cards that you would have loved to have in a deck you pulled apart 6 months ago
that is 76 pucapoints you no longer have available to get sent that card you 
really want. If that makes you 3 points shy of being able to be sent that big 
card the person sending just can't send it to you. And while you are waiting to
be able to receive that card it might be sent to someone else. 

Due to the nature of [Puca Trade][1] the feel bads from this are much greater, 
the percieved opportunity cost is much greater. Where previously losing 20c of 
value in a large trade didn't matter, now every 20 pucapoints helps towards
bigger trades.

The take home message is only put on cards that you really want. 

Also it's important to keep an eye on your wants list and format news. If you 
have many cards on your wants list and lots of spare points, usually because
you want lots of rare old cards, you can be surprised at how much you spent on
a card. When you listed the want it may have only been worth 25 pucapoints, but
when the card featured on camera in a legacy GP the card shot up to 400 
pucapoints and thousands of puca traders raced home to dig up a few coppies to 
try and send to poor suckers like you. 

This hasn't happened to me yet, but there is a new feature for [Rare Tier 
Members][3] that lets them limit the price that they are willing to pay for a 
card. That single feature is probably worth it to anyone who is looking to use
[Puca Trade][1] for
