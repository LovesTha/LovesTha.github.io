Getting cards with [Puca Trade][1] is the pain free bit, but it has dangers. As
it is a purely push system things can happen very quickly, even while you sleep.

When I first signed up to [Puca Trade][1] I used the import option to import my
want list from [Deckbox][2]. I'd been using Deckbox for a long time and had a 
literal bucket load of cards in my wants list. Many of them were random cheap 
old cards from early sets that people very rarely have for trade. They'd been on 
my want list for months or even years and occasionally one would get added to a 
trade to help balance out the prices and I'd be happy to have another weird card
in a commmander deck. It was all good.

It was all good because sometimes I'd start up a trade and find that some cards 
were suggested that were for decks I was no longer building. Sometimes I'd get 
them anyway as I'd use them eventually and I wasn't really losing anything; the 
value they contributed to the trade was minimal and the trade would happen with
two happy people wether the card was in the trade or not.

This is different on [Puca Trade][1], when someone sends you four random old 
cards that you would have loved to have in a deck you pulled apart 6 months ago
that is 76 pucapoints you no longer have available to get sent that card you 
really want. If that makes you 3 points shy of being able to be sent that big 
card the person sending just can't send it to you. And while you are waiting to
be able to receive that card it might be sent to someone else. 

Due to the nature of [Puca Trade][1] the feel bads from this are much greater, 
the percieved opportunity cost is much greater. Where previously losing 20c of 
value in a large trade didn't matter, now every 20 pucapoints helps towards
bigger trades.

The take home message is only put on cards that you really want. 

Also it's important to keep an eye on your wants list and format news. If you 
have many cards on your wants list and lots of spare points, usually because
you want lots of rare old cards, you can be surprised at how much you spent on
a card. When you listed the want it may have only been worth 25 pucapoints, but
when the card featured on camera in a legacy GP the card shot up to 400 
pucapoints and thousands of puca traders raced home to dig up a few coppies to 
try and send to poor suckers like you. 

This hasn't happened to me yet, but there is a new feature for [Rare Tier 
Members][3] that lets them limit the price that they are willing to pay for a 
card. That single feature is probably worth it to anyone who is looking to use
[Puca Trade][1] for speculation. Particularly if you are attempting to be a 
short term speculator.

What will happen constantly is someone will say they can send you a card, then
when they get home they will find that one of th following has happened:

* The card isn't in English.

* The card was previously eaten by a dog and is now "SP".

* The card was stolen by aliens.

* The card is in a deck they now want to play.

Naturally they'll say the card is missing when they think it was stolen by 
aliens or they just don't want to trade the card any more. With the condition
variations they will send you a nice polite message asking if you care. You are
well within your rights on the site to refuse or to ask for the price to be 
reduced. Personally I'm happy with slightly played cards, but you may want them
to send you a photo before accepting.

If you can't come to an agreement or they just cant send you the card any more
they will ask to cancel the trade and most of the time you should just accept
and move on. 

What is slightly counter intuitive to many is that when a trade is
cancled the card may or may not get added back to your wants lists 
automatically. I believe the threshold is based on time: under 30 minutes after 
they initiated the send and it will get added back but longer than that and 
you'll need to do it manually. That protection is so that people can't agree to
send you a card, wait a day, notice that the card went up 300 points over night,
cancel the trade and then resend you the card for the new higher value.

The Puca Trade guys have really thought through their platform :)
