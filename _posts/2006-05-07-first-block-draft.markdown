Don't we love the Pro Tour? It gives us great excuses to sit in front of a computer doing nothing more than post on our blogs.

Talking of the webcast, De Rosa should really learn to play his creatures after playing his land.

Back on topic, I drafted a 4 colour deck not drafting red. My biggest mistakes ended up being not taking the bomb Selesnya cards in pack 1. I passed up such goodies as Evangel and City-Tree, but did pick up such silly things as double Eviction to combo with Dismisser, Fists of Ironwood and double Hydropon. In round 3 game 1 I managed to have all of those in play with enough mana to play pretty much all of them every game.

Managing to go 2-2 with my deck proved that old Mirrodin piece of advice, 4 colours is more consistent than 3 some times. I was running 17 lands with just 1 Silkwing Scout to fix my mana, managing to never be significantly colour screwed with only a single mulligan. But I was very glad I dropped the Scarab due to its double green cost

I did feel that the deck was more of a 3-1 deck, not 2-2, but them be the breaks. Each of my losses were very close 2-1 affairs and the wins were easy 2-0 blow outs.
