We finally got our Internet connected last night. After having to wait a full week for the phone to be connected before we could actually order the ADSL2+ service. Then being told that the ADSL2+ can take 10 to 15 business days (only took 4) it was finally installed.

So what does iiNet do yesterday? They announce that they will start to offer a 'naked dsl' package. So we'd get 50% more downloads (although they would start to include uploads in that figure) for $10 less every month. Oh and its super easy and quick to go onto these new plans.

Well, unless you are already on ADSL2+ with iiNet, like we are, because for some reason in that case you can be without the Internet for 2-3 weeks and without phone for 1 week, although we don't mind having no phone.

Why do the Internet gods hate us so much?
