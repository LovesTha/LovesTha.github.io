So I saw the doctor on Saturday. While he couldn't find anything particularly
wrong with my shoulder, he recommended not using it heavily for 2 weeks. With
beautiful weather like:

I'm finding it hard to resist going for a ride. Coupled with buying new riding
shoes on Saturday and mounting my new rack it is getting realy hard.

I'm not going to last 2 weeks. More like I'm going to skip 2 days of commuting.
Including last Friday and today that means I'm free to commute on Wednesday.

Surely it wont make my arm pine for the fjords.
