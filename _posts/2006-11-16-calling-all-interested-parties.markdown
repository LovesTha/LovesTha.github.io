I'm looking for any comments people have about the Two Headed Giant events. Not that I think there is anything wrong with them, just that I know that its not perfect. Mainly because nothing is perfect.

So feel free to leave comments or to email me at gareth@cerberos.id.au.  I look forward to people telling me many hair brained ideas, hopefully at least one of them will be useful :)
