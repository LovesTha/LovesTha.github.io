Peter Garret challenged the current government MP's to announce which of them would be happy to have a nuclear power plant in their electorates, but the [government defeated his motion](http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200703/s1860172.htm).

This would be the ranking of power sources I'd want in my electorate if I was a Politician:



	
  1. Innovative clean energy (like the 1km glass tower that was proposed a few years ago)

	
  2. Wind

	
  3. Geothermal

	
  4. Solar

	
  5. Wave

	
  6. Tidal

	
  7. Hydro

	
  8. Nuclear

	
  9. Gas

	
  10. Coal


Sure its a big jump from Hydro to Nuclear, but not as big as the jump to the polluting fossil fuels.
