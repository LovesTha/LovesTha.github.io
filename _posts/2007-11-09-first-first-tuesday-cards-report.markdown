We had the first card night this week and it was a good night. Numbers were fine, but it feels like our advertising was a miss. The only people from outside Northern who turned up were a couple with a young boy who were interested in checking out who we were as a church.

While I believe they had a good time and learnt something about the way we do things, they weren't apart of the target audience. It would be wrong to complain about missing our target audience by just a little bit, but we really were shooting for local heathens, Christians from north of the ring road is about as far wrong as we could be :(
