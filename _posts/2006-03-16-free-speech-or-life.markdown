Just watching Hotel Rwanda at the moment.
It really puts a few universal rights under an interesting spot light. The root right that was first forgotten was that everyone is equal. When the Portuguese first came in and elevated one clan over the other and disturbed the natural economy between them it set in motion the terrible actions depicted.
But this is ancient history and hopefully wont be repeated
What has sparked my thoughts though is the radio station depicted in the film, it is used by the spiritual leaders to help incite violence. Early in the film all it is saying is that there need to be a shift in power and that the other group are worthless, does this mean we should ban any speech which goes against the basic principles we hold dear? I think yes.
But what are these basic principles? I hold dear:
Freedom of association
Freedom of religion
Personal security
Equality of all people (and their equal rights to the bounty of the world, what a pity communism doesn't work)
and such things, but you have a hard time granting them without letting people speak against them. I guess its a good thing I aren't in the position to try and change these things as I don't know the answer.
