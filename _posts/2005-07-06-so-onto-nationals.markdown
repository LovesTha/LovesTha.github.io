But you heard me say I came 17th (even though the online details on the DCI site say I came 24th BOOO), so what am I doing saying I'm going to nationals? Well me and Warren (and his fiance and fiance's friend) are going to drive up to Canberra and try and grind in, then be happy to scrub out of the main event in time to play in the vintage national championship.




So now comes the tough point of trying to work out what collection of decks were going to turn up with. Some build of TnN will be sitting our bag I'm sure as it might just be the best thing to play. A few deck lists of mono red decks will also be floating in said bag with all the cards in matching sleeves so what ever build we feel like at the time is possible (agro, medium and big red being the main choices). Then some mono blue control deck is also likely to be around, probably featuring proteus staff as the win condition as I hear its some good. Kagemaro, Only to See Play will also be in attendance with all of his fun little creature hating friends.




Which brings us around to our current dilemma, what is the best deck at beating Kagemaro and friends? I don't think that mono black has great matchups against all that many (serious) decks, but the deck may be built better by some smart guy leaving us needing to beat it. With what?
