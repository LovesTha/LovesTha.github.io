Its 9.25 am as I start writing this post. If your wondering what I'm doing up at 9.26 am on a cold Saturday morning, its because I'm meant to be running a 2HG sealed event. It has a schuled start time of 9.30 am.

The next logical question is, if I am running a selaed 2HG event at 9.30 am, why am I not busly entering peoples details into DCIR at 9.28 am? That would be because as I write this sentence the first person has turned up, at 9.29 am.

So now its 10.20 am and theres is only 3 people here to play, time to go home.
