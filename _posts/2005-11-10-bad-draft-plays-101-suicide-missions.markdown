Was playing in a Ravnica Draft last night and drafted a hot aggro Dimir deck, with such niceties as:
2x Mark of Eviction
2x Snapping Drake
2x Dimir Guildmage
1x Moroii
1x Vedalken Dismisser
2x Flight of Fancy
1x Clutch of the Undercity
1x Keening Banshee

Plus the ultimate combo rare for the deck: Followed Footsteps.

Yes I did manage to get the Footsteps onto both the Keening Banshee and the Vedalken Dismisser, although it only triggered when on the Dismisser.

In the first round against probably the best player in Melbourne, David Zhao (his recent results seam to indicate that he is the best player in probably Australia), we'd split the first two games and were heading into the 3rd. My opening hand had both Snapping Drakes, the Dismisser and Footsteps combo. My deck was curving out nicely with a turn 2 Surveilling Sprite (answered with Sparkmage Apprentice #1), turn 3 Terraformer and turn 4 Snapping Drake.

On Zhao's next turn he attacks with the Apprentice, (I've either attacked with the Terraformer or he's already killed it with burn) and I have to decide to block or not. If I'd been thinking properly I would have done a proper risk assessment, if I block I allow Zhao to kill my Drake with a second Apprentice, if I don't block I take 1 damage and don't risk my 3/2 flyer and I know that I'm definitely trying to be the beat down here as I've got a second 3/2 in hand and a Dismisser to drop later to force through extra damage.

As it turns out I blocked and he dropped Apprentice #2.

On my turn I dropped a land and Drake #2 and passed the turn. Zhao then followed suit by repeating his last turn: Attack with Apprentice. Naturally I thought if anything it was safer to block now as he was less likely to have a 3rd Apprentice in hand. So I block, Zhao drops Apprentice #3 and most of my gas is spent, when I eventually play the Footsteps on the Dismisser (actually I must have been a Banshee I think) Zhao top decks a Dogpile and attacks with his 2 creatures to kill it.

If I had of read Zhao better (no easy task) I wouldn't have block with either Snapping Drake so I would have kept 1 and had my Terraformer holding off his 3 Apprentices and 1 Drake left over to give Zhao a 6 turn clock, which from memory probably would have gone all the way.

When I look back over my draft results at CardHeaven I don't feel so bad as most of the time the 1 loss I have that keeps me off winning a draft is against a Good Player, and they don't get much better than Zhao. Other then loosing to Zhao I didn't drop a game in the next 5 I played with the deck, but finished an unlucky 4th (2 boosters to 1st and 1 to 2nd and 3rd, nothing for 4th, and my first pick in the rare draft was just a Hierarch) as Zhao failed to win the final. Still my 1 draft win at CardHeaven was by beating Zhao's Splice Mill deck, but that was a 2-0-1 draft win, after drawing round 1.

PS: managed to snag 15 uncommons in this draft, but nothing as good as a Putrefy :(, but I do need more suppression fields.
