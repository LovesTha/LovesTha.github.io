Recently the Judge sponsorship results for PT:KL have come out and you'll see on the list someone by the name of "Gareth Pyre" who is volunteering for the event. I have been assured that its just a typo and they do mean me. So Malaysia here I come.

Coincidently a friend of mine is heading to India at roughly the same time, so I've cajoled her into letting me tag along and make a general nuisance of my self. Three weeks traveling around India should be a lot of fun, if a stretch of the budget. The fun things in life are never easy.

Any recommendations on what to see/do in India?
