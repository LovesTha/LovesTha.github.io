Yesterday I [asked a question][1]: What game do you play the most? Today I'm 
asking the follow up question:

# What Does That Game Make You Awesome At?

Playing games is great training for real world things. There is one small thing 
that one needs to do to make playing games really effective, a real life 
changer:

_Believe That Playing Games Is Good For You_

I know you are going to say that is either the silliest thing you've heard or 
that it is the very definition of the placebo effect. Both of those are true
but the research says that is the single biggest indicator of games being 
good for you.

It might be more accurate to say that people who think games are purely trivial
and a waste of time get bad results from playing games, so at least avoid 
thinking that way.

So lets all think about what game we play the most. Think about the skills that
the game exercises, what healthy habits it builds.

Lets take my answer from yesterday: Magic. When I'm playing limited it's a 
constant struggle to figure out how to win, commonly from bad situations with
what look like insufficient tools for the job. Trying to get through such 
situations requires strong analytic thinking and tests my abilities to keep a
positive outlook.

When playing Commander I have to exercise my social skills, it's surprising
that I can refer to my social skills with a straight face. I'm your typical 
nerd, limited social skills and rather awkward in a crowd. Playing multiplayer
formats forces me to do things I really don't enjoy, and it's impossible to
just ignore them and still win. Winning requires keeping up friendly 
interactions with the other players so they don't gang up on you.

How do your games make you better at life?
