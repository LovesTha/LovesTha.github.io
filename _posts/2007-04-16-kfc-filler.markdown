Ok so I had a KFC Filler last night for the first time. The experience was about as expected, rating a 1.5 of the burger scale:
0.0 - No Burger :(
0.5 - McDonalds Cheese Burger
1.0 - Big Mac
1.5 - KFC Filler
2.0 - Any burger at Hungry Jacks
4.0 - Average Fish and Chips shop burger
5.0 - Good Fish and Chip shop burger (significantly better ingredients than the average F&C shops)
7.0 - BBNT burger (Burgers Burritos Nachos and Tacos, another small chain in Melbourne)
9.5 - Grillâ€™d
