I've never seen a racing simulator game with realistic controls. Nearly every one has the following controls on modern consoles:

Stick (left<->right): Steering
? Button: Accelerator
? Button: Brake
? Button: Gear Up
? Button: Gear Down

Last time I looked at a car (well a manual one) these were the inputs you have:

<!-- more -->

Analogue: Steering
Analogue: Accelerator
Analogue: Brake
Analogue: Clutch
Digital: Gear

Things have come a long way from having to do your steering using digital buttons, making it much easier for games to let you control a car at high speed. But they still use digital inputs for accelerator and brake, both things that should be analogue. Also I've never seen a game with a clutch.

With older consoles that only have digital inputs this was acceptable, but modern consoles like the PS3 have two little joy sticks, that gives them enough analogue inputs to control the 4 analogue inputs of a real car.

I would love to play a racing sim that had the clutch as something I had to control. Make the controller shake a little bit as the clutch gets to its friction point, and if I let the clutch out without providing any gas, stall the car.

Naturally make it an optional part of the game, but I suspect plenty of people will buy the game just because it has the most skill intensive driving mode around. What else do the modern racing sims have to compete on? They all look good, etc.
