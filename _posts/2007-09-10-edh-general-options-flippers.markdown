A quick search for Legendary Creatures with 'flip' in their text (I like to use datatog on IRC for my searches) reveals 20 options for building decks around. Although many of them require your play group to allow for generals that are only legendary after some condition is met, I don't think I'll have too much issue there.

The biggest down side to all these generals is that your are forced into a single colour, I might like the challenge though.<!-- more -->

Akki Lavarunner 3R
Creature - Goblin Warrior
1/1
Haste
Whenever Akki Lavarunner deals damage to an opponent, flip it.
-----
Tok-Tok, Volcano Born
Legendary Creature - Goblin Shaman
2/2
Protection from red
If a red source would deal damage to a player, it deals that much damage plus 1 to that player instead.

This guy has a lot of legs as an idea for a deck, I'm just not sure if mono red burn is a viable multiplayer strategy. Although it might be ok if using as many inferno style effects as possible. Still are there enough? If their is this guy might make your play group feel like not allowing this class of flippers.

Budoka Pupil 1GG
Creature - Human Monk
2/2
Whenever you play a Spirit or Arcane spell, you may put a ki counter on Budoka Pupil.
At end of turn, if there are two or more ki counters on Budoka Pupil, you may flip it.
----
Ichiga, Who Topples Oaks
Legendary Creature - Spirit
4/3
Trample
Remove a ki counter from Ichiga, Who Topples Oaks: Target creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn.

I'm not going to bother discussing the Ki counter guys as I don't believe any colour has enough spirit/arcane cards that will fit into the theme of a EDH deck to make it work.

Callow Jushi 1UU
Creature - Human Wizard
2/2
Whenever you play a Spirit or Arcane spell, you may put a ki counter on Callow Jushi.
At end of turn, if there are two or more ki counters on Callow Jushi, you may flip it.
----
Jaraku the Interloper
Legendary Creature - Spirit
3/4
Remove a ki counter from Jaraku the Interloper: Counter target spell unless its controller pays 2.

See above.

Cunning Bandit 1RR
Creature - Human Warrior
2/2
Whenever you play a Spirit or Arcane spell, you may put a ki counter on Cunning Bandit.
At end of turn, if there are two or more ki counters on Cunning Bandit, you may flip it.
----
Azamuki, Treachery Incarnate
Legendary Creature - Spirit
5/2
Remove a ki counter from Azamuki, Treachery Incarnate: Gain control of target creature until end of turn.

See above.

Faithful Squire 1WW
Creature - Human Soldier
2/2
Whenever you play a Spirit or Arcane spell, you may put a ki counter on Faithful Squire.
At end of turn, if there are two or more ki counters on Faithful Squire, you may flip it.
-----
Kaiso, Memory of Loyalty
Legendary Creature - Spirit
3/4
Flying Remove a ki counter from Kaiso, Memory of Loyalty: Prevent all damage that would be dealt to target creature this turn.

See above.

Hired Muscle 1BB
Creature - Human Warrior
2/2
Whenever you play a Spirit or Arcane spell, you may put a ki counter on Hired Muscle.
At end of turn, if there are two or more ki counters on Hired Muscle, you may flip it.
----
Scarmaker
Legendary Creature - Spirit
4/4
Remove a ki counter from Scarmaker: Target creature gains fear until end of turn.

See above.

Kitsune Mystic 3W
Creature - Fox Wizard
2/3
At end of turn, if Kitsune Mystic is enchanted by two or more Auras, flip it.
-----
Autumn-Tail, Kitsune Sage
Legendary Creature - Fox Wizard
4/5
1: Attach target Aura attached to a creature to another creature.

This might just make it, although a deck built around auras doesn't feel like enough fun. Also not powerful enough when flipped.

Student of Elements 1U
Creature - Human Wizard
1/1
When Student of Elements has flying, flip it.
-----
Tobita, Master of Winds
Legendary Creature - Human Wizard
3/3
Creatures you control have flying.

Wooo flying, woopdy do.

Now for the ones that show more promise

Erayo, Soratami Ascendant 1U
Legendary Creature - Moonfolk Monk
1/1
Flying
Whenever the fourth spell of a turn is played, flip Erayo, Soratami Ascendant.
-----
Erayo's Essence Legendary Enchantment Whenever an opponent plays a spell for the first time in a turn, counter that spell.

This seems to be the perfect legend for a mono blue control style EDH deck. Players may attempt to horde spells to overwhelm this strategy but it is likely to back fire on players regularly, by stopping them from interupting the other players.

Homura, Human Ascendant 4RR
Legendary Creature - Human Monk
4/4
Homura, Human Ascendant can't block.
When Homura is put into a graveyard from play, return it to play flipped.
-----
Homura's Essence Legendary Enchantment Creatures you control get +2/+2 and have flying and "R: This creature gets +1/+0 until end of turn."

He looks quite good untill you realise you don't have many ways to sacrifice him, just:

(1) Blood Rites (2) Bloodshot Cyclops (3) Fiery Conclusion (4) Fling (5) Goblin Bombardment (6) Grab the Reins (7) Mons's Goblin Waiters (8) Orcish Bloodpainter (9) Pygmy Giant (10) Reckless Abandon (11) Rupture (12) Scorched Rusalka (13) Shivan Harvest (14) Thermopod

And two of them are silver bordered.

Kuon, Ogre Ascendant BBB
Legendary Creature - Ogre Monk
2/4
At end of turn, if three or more creatures were put into graveyards from play this turn, flip Kuon, Ogre Ascendant.
-----
Kuon's Essence
Legendary Enchantment
At the beginning of each player's upkeep, that player sacrifices a creature.

Easy to flip, and very useful effect. Pity it doesn't make for an interesting deck.

Rune-Tail, Kitsune Ascendant 2W
Legendary Creature - Fox Monk
2/2
When you have 30 or more life, flip Rune-Tail, Kitsune Ascendant.
-----
Rune-Tail's Essence
Legendary Enchantment
Prevent all damage that would be dealt to creatures you control.

Remember you need to reach 1.5x your starting life total to flip it. Which isn't always easy. It requires two different decks to work, a life gain deck, then one that wants tough dudes. Not easy to fit in one deck.

Sasaya, Orochi Ascendant 1GG
Legendary Creature - Snake Monk
2/3
Reveal your hand: If you have seven or more land cards in your hand, flip Sasaya, Orochi Ascendant.
-----
Sasaya's Essence
Legendary Enchantment
Whenever a land you control is tapped for mana, add one mana of that type to your mana pool for each other land you control with the same name.

Flipping this shouldn't be too hard, but it also doesn't feel like an interesting deck.

No real winners here :( Although I might give Akki Lavarunner a try.
