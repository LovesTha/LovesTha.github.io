Is everyone else getting excited about Ravnica: City of Guilds?




The sheer number of good cards seams to be stagering, and rumour that it will contain the second best ever dual lands (behind the original duals) is amazing.  Thats in adition to the filter artifacts:




Boros Signet   2  

Artifact (c)  

1, T: Add BR to your mana pool




I mean there strictly better than the talismans except when you want to only produce 1 mana (which is rare, and when you do these will just cause 1 pain, which is still better than the talismans).  These also don't suffer from the problems of the filter lands, just the normal problems of a mana accelerant.
