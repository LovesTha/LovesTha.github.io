	**July 2006:**
	**Coldsnap**

From the frozen vaults deep below Wizards of the Coast, Coldsnap, the legendary Lost Third Set of the Ice Age Block is coming out at last. It's not part of Ravnica Block, it's not part of the block after that. But -- get this -- it will be tournament-legal!

Intrigued? Tune back in on Wednesday, when Randy Buehler will explain all.

So Coldsnap will be released during July next year will it. That's a bit of a surprise. It'll be interesting to see what they do with it, there are just so many odd things they can do.

Like the Fat Pack for it could have 50% snow-covered lands, which would be pretty cool (pun intended)
