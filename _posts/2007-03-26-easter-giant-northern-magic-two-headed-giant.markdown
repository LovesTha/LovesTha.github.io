It appears I am attempting to imitate a female stereotype, the 7th of April Two Headed Giant is back on again. This could be the last 2HG in Melbourne before the PTQ, but who knows?

Anyways here's the details, nothing of note has changed:



When: Saturday the 7th of April.
Time: 9.30am.
Where: Northern Community.
Address: 81 High Street Preston.
Cost: $50/team ($25/player).
Product: 1 TimeSpiral Tournament pack, 1 TimeSpiral booster and 3 Planar Chaos Boosters.

Please drop me a line to let me know that your coming along so I can
guarantee that I have enough product for everyone.
Email: [gareth@cerberos.id.au](mailto:gareth%40cerberos.id.au) or Phone: 0403 179 234.
