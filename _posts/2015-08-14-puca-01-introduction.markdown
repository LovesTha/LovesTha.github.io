[Puca Trade][1] is the current hottest thing in Magic card trading. Trading 
card games are both *games* and a bunch of cards to *trade*. Hopefully this 
revelation isn't too earth shattering for any of the readers of this blog.
While the game of Magic is very very complex, trading isn't as simple as it
would appear on first blush.

In the early days I believe there was two issues with trading: It was hard to 
find people who played magic and no one knew what cards were worth. The first
was solved as more people go into the game and the second was partially solved
when Scrye was printed as a definitive price guide.

With those two problems out of the way the new restriction on trading was not
finding people who played but finding people who wanted to trade. For a trade
to happen you need to find someone who has a card you want, then they need to
have things they want from you and finally the two of you have to agree on 
values enough to agree to trade and be able to find a trade that both find 
advantageous. Or at least not feel like they are being robbed.

This can be pretty hard to do, personally there are about 15 cards I'm actively
looking for and another thousand I'd be happy to acquire as of today. But out of
the 15 thousand odd cards printed that makes it unlikely that I want anything 
out of the hundred odd cards most people carry in a trade folder. So once the
Internet became popular people started trading on it. 

The most recent incarnation of this is the numerous Facebook groups dedicated to 
trading Magic cards. There are probably thousands of such groups, most of them 
split up in different geographical regions but then there are several global ones 
for the trading of harder to find items where shipping internationally isn't a 
big concern.

There are even some reasonably sophisticated websites dedicated to helping 
facilitate trades. Up until recently I'd been using [Deck Box][3] to do this. 
They let you populate their database with your collection and wants list and then
generate a list of users who have matching collections and wants and then you get
to negotiate to make a trade. It certainly beats trawling have and wants lists 
manually to find someone who would make a good trade with you.

[Puca Trade][1] takes it to the next level by abstracting the trade process a bit
more. Instead of matching people who have mutual haves and wants it uses a 
currency to try and facilitate trading. Now you send cards to people who want 
them to earn *Puca points* and people send you cards to earn *Puca points* from 
you.

In the same way that the concept of currency accelerated commerce so that we can
have lots of people employed in things that aren't directly tied to food 
creation *Puca points* are accelerating trade in Magic cards.

Now it is easy to trade lots of small cards into large cards without needing to 
grind out many intermediate steps or lose 60% of value by selling and buying 
from stores. Even stores are using to to efficiently move stock that doesn't have 
a strong local demand and get stock that will sell quickly.

So if I've already sold you run on over and [create an account][1], but be careful
those first few hundred *Puca points* you get for signing up (and the 100 I'll get
if you sign up via a link on this page) can Disappear quickly once you add cards
to you wants list.

In the next part of this series I go over how to get points, an important step in 
getting cards from [Puca Trade][1] Please subscribe to the [RSS feed][4] if you would
