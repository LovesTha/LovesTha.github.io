This past weekend was GP Sydney and while we only ended up with 996 players, 
missing by such a small margin on Australia breaking into the 1k player club, 
it was a great event and there is much to learn from it. Notably it premiered 
the Sydney Swap, a way to reduce the desire for players to drop during deck
registration.
