I've been thinking about this Azorious based deck for a while now, all I really needs is some dual lands, but I'm sure Dissension will have some other goodies for it.

<!-- more -->Disruption:
4x Leyline of Singularity
3x Faiths Fetters
3x Confiscate (this is the slot I think is most likely to be replaced in Dissension, I'm hoping for a good UW permanent stealer)
3x Threads of Disloyalty
3x Pacifism
3x Spirit Link
3x Cage of Hands

Win Conditions:
4x Hunted Phantasm

Control:
4x Remand
4x Hinder
4x Remand

naturally some collection of land to let you cast this type of stuff.

This decks signature opening play is obviously opening hand Leyline with turn 3 Phantasm. The best late game play it can make is remand Fetters in response to the second copy of a bomb being played, your paying just 7WU to draw 2 cards, gain 4 life and nullify another one of their permanents. All this is trying to do is use leyline of Singularity to turn all of your 1 for 1 enchantment based removal spells turn into 2 for 1s.

So does anyone out there have any opinion of this deck?
