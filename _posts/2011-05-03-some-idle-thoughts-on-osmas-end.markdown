While I believe that the US's response to September 11 was completely wrong, I don't have too many issues with how they handled this particular tiny facet of it.
When they knew where he was they needed to do something about it, and what they did about it was probably right.
They were trying to capture him, which I support, although I wonder where they were going to take him.
When he tried to attack the soldiers they defended themselves, it was a plausible outcome so we shouldn't be surprised.
When they had a dead Osama I think they should have just made a positive ID (taken finger prints, sample of DNA, photos) and left the body.
I understand why they didn't do that though: So they could make a better ID on the boat and so there would be no grave of Osama to rally around.
While that choice will cause some greater unrest in the short term it might be the better answer in the long run - we'll never know.
