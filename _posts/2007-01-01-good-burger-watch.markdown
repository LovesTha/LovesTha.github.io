On the way home from McCrae yesterday we stopped in at a cafe in (roughly) McCrae for lunch. I decided that the most appetising item on the menu was the burger and ordered it with some reservations.

What greeted me was the best non Grill'd burger I've ever eaten, scoring a 8.5 on my burger scale, the most significant point deduction being the bun, it was good real bread but nothing special. The pattie was large and juicy, the bacon crispy and the sauce was a good and chunky.

Now my scale looks like:<!-- more -->
0.0 - No Burger :(
0.5 - McDonalds Cheese Burger
1.0 - Big Mac
2.0 - Any burger at Hungry Jacks
4.0 - Average Fish and Chips shop burger
5.0 - Good Fish and Chip shop burger (significantly better ingredients than the average F&C shops)
7.0 - BBNT burger (Burgers Burritos Nachos and Tacos, another small chain in Melbourne)
8.5 - Burger at Trims  Cafe, McCrae (<strike>I'm sure Phil or Dan will chime in with this cafes name </strike>Thanks Dan)
9.5 - Grillâ€™d

See my previous [burger post](http://rockpaperdynamite.wordpress.com/2006/09/14/grilld/) for greater information on the scale.
