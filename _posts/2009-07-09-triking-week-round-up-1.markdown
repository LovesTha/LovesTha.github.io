So I'm making this slightly early, as there is still Friday left for triking, but three days in a row appears to have given my legs enough.

So some stats:

Week total distance: 13.5km

Total Distance: 19.8km

**Interesting Story for the week:**

So I was riding home from work for the first time and was going along the side of a road on the foot path. I notice an egg flying past me then a the black commodore that was driving past slowly accelerates away.

Don't most people grow out of that type of behaviour before they get old enough to have a car?
