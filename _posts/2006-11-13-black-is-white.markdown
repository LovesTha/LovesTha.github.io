Random Tip #1:

Instead of using '</sarcasm>' online to indicate that you've been using some humor just use this adaptation of a great SciFi/Humor quote:

"/me for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing."

1 small golden star to the commenter who recognises the source of this quote.

1 brown splotch to anyone who uses google to find it.

The ![Gold Star](http://members.optusnet.com.au/cerberos2/GoldStar.jpg)  is awarded to Dan. Now I feel like a silly game show host.
