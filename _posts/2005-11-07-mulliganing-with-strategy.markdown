I've never been very good at mulliganing, pretty much all I have ever done is:



	
  1. Do I have enough land:

	
    1. >= 2 Land

	
    2. 
	
    3. Or some way to see many cards with the opening hand even without 2 permanent mana sources (for example in Type1 I'd keep a hand with Island, Ancestral recall, Lotus Petal and accumulated Knowledge)




	
  2. Do have anything to do:

	
    1. A decent creature

	
    2. Some permission

	
    3. Some card draw





Now naturally what I was playing affected my definitions of "decent creature" and such, but that was pretty much all I was thinking about when deciding to mulligan. In the last few hours I've been thinking that maybe muliganing would be a good first place to start thinking about strategy.
Along this idea I think that a mulligan should be taken after working out what the current hands strategy will be, and weather that will be good enough. I don't think this will ever lead to me not taking a mulligan where I have been, but will lead to me muliganing more average hands. The ones that have land and spells, in a reasonable proportion but just don't look like they want to do anything constructive.
I think this is just a general reaction to many of the articles I've been reading lately though. A lot of strategy articles have been about the need for strategy during a game and how having one will benefit the player.
So yeah, do stuff with, umm strategy, and yeah, purpose as well.
