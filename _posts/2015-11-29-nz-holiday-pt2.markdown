The closest to a Lord of the Rings related activity we did was when I went to 
the toilet at Christchurch Airport it was clearly built by hobbits. The toilet
paper dispensers were mounted so low it was very hard to get paper out of them.
When I got back to where the wife was sitting my joke about the hobit facilities
fell flat. Just like most of my jokes.
