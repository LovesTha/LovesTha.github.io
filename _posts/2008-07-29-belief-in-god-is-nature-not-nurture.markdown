[Digger's Blog](http://www.diggerrandle.com/2008/07/are-babies-hard-wired-to-believe-in-god.html) brought to my attention to a [SMH](http://www.theage.com.au/national/infants-have-natural-belief-in-god-20080725-3l3b.html) article about a psychologist who has done some research into what and how children think about God.  Some clicking through gets you to an [interview with the psychologist ](http://www.science-spirit.org/article_detail.php?article_id=128)[Olivera Petrovich](http://www.science-spirit.org/article_detail.php?article_id=128) that gives much more detail and is very worth reading. 

My favourite quote from the interview is:


<blockquote>Children’s descriptions are very basic, whereas adults use more sophisticated vocabulary, but there is no more information about God in adults’ references than there is in children’s. I think this is perfectly plausible and predictable because we can’t say that we as adults have more privileged access to God than children do. We’re all in the same position.</blockquote>


She also comments that Japanese children all think of a creator god, although that concept is not apart of the Shinto religion. Which is a pretty good piece of evidence for the conclusion that belief is a natural thing.

Have a read of the interview for your self, its well worth the read.
