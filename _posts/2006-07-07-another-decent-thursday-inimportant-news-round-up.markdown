I lost in the final of another Card Heaven draft yesterday. This time it was a crushing defeat at the hands of a very powerful deck piloted by a skilled local talent, Liam Shiels.

But just to make things a little bit different I decided to loose to Tom Gaddy in the first round of the second draft, but still wound up 2-1. In more depressing news Bruce told me that his limited rating is now above 1700 (in all seriousness, way to go mate, maybe sometime soon people will stop thinking of me as the good player at TGV, really I suck), and at this time mines at the mega impressive: 1664.
