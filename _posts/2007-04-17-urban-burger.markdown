There's been a request for my impression of Urban Burger in another thread so here goes.

My initial thought was that I wanted to give them a 8, which seems appropriate. Their bun is really sub standard, about the same as what I get at BBNT recently, very fluffy and sugary. They do use good quality ingredients and have significant variety on their menu. Also they go for a short and wide burger, I seem to prefer the tall and thin.
