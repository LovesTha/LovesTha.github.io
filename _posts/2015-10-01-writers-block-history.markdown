The famous Seth Godin published a [blog post][1] that claimed that writers block is a recent invention.

My favourite comic, Randal Munroe, made a [great comic][2] about claiming anything is a new problem.

I bet when Moses* sat down to write his bits of the old testament he suffered from writers block. Or maybe he didn't because he was all badass and just got on with it.

Other than the claim about when writers block was invented his [post][1] is spot on.


I've got to get on with things more. 

* Not going for biblical/historical or any other form of accuracy here, just implying it's old.
