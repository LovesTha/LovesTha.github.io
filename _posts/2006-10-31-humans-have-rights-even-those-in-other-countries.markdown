While reading an article about the way the Pentagon is trying to restructure its communications areas I stumbled on this snippet of 'acceptable' US policy:


_  "Information operations" is a military term used to describe propaganda aimed at influencing foreign audiences. _




_  Traditional Pentagon public affairs, on the other hand, is bound by laws that prohibits propagandising __US citizens. -__ [Pentagon targets new media in Iraq PR offensive](http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200610/s1777817.htm)_




This double standard is just another every day example of what is wrong in the world. Every country is riddled with double standards and there is no one standing up as the golden example to follow.




America holds it self up as the template for how a modern country should be,  but it can't manage to treat people in other countries with respect. If its not appropriate for your own people, its not good enough for anyone.
