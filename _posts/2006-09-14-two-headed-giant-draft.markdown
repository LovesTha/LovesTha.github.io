In a couple of recent articles on [MagicTheGathering.com](MagicTheGathering.com) by [Brian David Marshall](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/bd243) and [Noah Well](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/nw20) have discussed what is going to be the format of the Two Headed Giant Pro Tour event next year.

In brief, 4 teams of 2 players sit down at a table with 6 boosters in front of them, for a full block you have 2 of each set. Then each team opens a single booster and picks 2 cards from it, passing the rest of the pack to the left. Repeat this for the rest of the pack and packs. Then build 2 decks from the cards selected by the team.

My other half for the draft was Andrew Varga, one of the better players in Melbourne and the best who is interested in Two Headed Giant. Luckily for me his usual second head wasn't around last night :). When we were passed a Glimpse the Unthinkable in pack 1 we knew what one of the decks was. The draft then  progressed fairly normally except we didn't draft many green cards. I was fairly worried about getting no Enigma Eidolons in the first Dissension pack, but we picked up 4 in the second.<!-- more -->

My most noteable cards were:
1x Glimpse the Unthinkable
2x Izzet Chronarchs
4x Enigma Eidolons
1x Dowsing Shaman
2x Seal of Doom

Varga's Deck contained these gems:
1x Isperia the Inscrutable
Xx Flyers

And between the two decks we had two or three of both of the Izzet enhanced creatures :)

Admittedly rounds 2 and 3 were fairly non eventful as our opponents were fairly mana flooded or screwed, but I think our decks were likely to win regardless.

Overall I can't wait for this format to be sanctioned.
