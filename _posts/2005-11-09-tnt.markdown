I have to say that playing with this deck is an awful amount of fun, it has so much sheer power. I'm pretty sure that I would have gone better with it if I had of played it a little bit more aggresivly.
Whenever I looked at the game state and noticed that I was going to loose on the next turn I would just decide to win, and most of the time the deck complied. Sure this was mainly when I had a Tog in play and a Grave-Troll in the graveyard or hand, but that wasn't a very unusual game state.
The look of surprise when you win the game when your opponent is sitting on 28 life, or with a Wurm in play with a Jitte with 2 counters equipt. And all that from nothing in play beyond a Tog and 2 or 3 cards in hand. With 2 Collesiums in play you can get your self 7 draws which can all be replaced with dredge 6, giving 48 cards in the graveyard, which will always put a Brawn or Wonder into the graveyard.
Still it does seam like too much of a predictable deck to be truely fun :(

PS: the title of this post makes sense because I'm currently trying to ring JJJ to mise some tickets the the JCDC concert.
