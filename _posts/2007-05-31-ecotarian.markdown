For a quick definition of the word, I grabbed this from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotarian):


<blockquote>_"When ecotarians make a consumption decision, they consider the impact on the land of growing the product, the impact of transporting the product from where it was produced[](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_miles), and the labor conditions for the people who grow the product."_</blockquote>


At tangent on Tuesday night we read over Genesis 1&2 (the story of creation) and discussed what it means to be stewards of everything. I quickly gravitated to a concept that has been banging around my head for quite a while now: Eating in a resource sustainable way.

So these are my rough rules:



	
  1. No produce that is terrible for Australia's environment (most European animals do not co-exist with Australian fauna efficiently, so this rules out beef, pork and dairy, and possibly other meats)

	
  2. Nothing that needs to be shipped internationally, and limit the cross country foods.

	
  3. Must be in season, or be stored without excessive use of energy. This allows the consumption of grains all year, and I suspect maybe potatoes, but research will tell. The aim is for things that a 10th century person could eat.


Tangent wants us to do our thing for 2 months, I want to see if I can pull it off for much more than that.

Am I nuts? (hrm I wonder if 10th century man could store nuts for all year use?)
