Playing in some more odd formats on Saturday, Guildwars (just a single Ravnica Block guild, in block constructed format) and Ravnica Block Two Headed Giant. So naturally I'm going to put together a deck for both formats, building two different decks seams like too much trouble.

Building a deck for such an unknown format posses some problems, have to ensure that its quick enough to cope by it self and have a relevant long game so that it isn't swamped in the Two Headed Giant late game. The card I am going to build around for this format is: Mark of Eviction.

Defensively MoE is very good at trying to generate some tempo in the early game. When built around correctly it can also create alot of good pressure in the late game. When thinking of a MoE deck the following cards jump to mind:

Blue:
Flight of Fancy
Spawnbroker
Steamcore Weird
Veldaken Dismisser
Veldaken Plotter<!-- more -->

Black:
Screeching Harpy

Red:
Izzet Chronarch
Ogre Gatecrasher
Ogre Savant
Sparkmage Apprentice
Galvanic Arc

Green:
Coiling Oracle

White:
not much

For no, particularly good reason I think I'm liking the Red options the most, so lets see what happens when I try to setup a Izzet deck:

Izzet phun:
4x Mark of Eviction
2x Flight of Fancy
4x Galvanic Arc

4x  Sparkmage Apprentice
4x Ogre Savant
4x Steamcore Weird
3x Veldaken Dismisser
4x Spawn Broker

4x Peel from Reality
4x Electrolyze

4x Izzet Boilerworks
4x Steam Vents
7x Mountain
8x Island

Lets see how that plays.
