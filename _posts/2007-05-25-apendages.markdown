Politics is a mad beast, when the oposition leader commented that his wife wasn't an "appendage of a middle-aged man" people get worked up about him slighting stay at home mothers. In the context of the heat about her business all I take from that comment is that his wife is an autonomous person, not some puppet of his.

Isn't this what should make women happy, a clear basic offhand comment that afirms that women are equals.

Who has the shotgun? Thats the tools thats needed for mad beasts.
