A couple of months ago I visited a great little random restaurant in Ivanhoe (which is soon to become my new suburb of residence, but I doubt any one who is reading this and cares doesn't know that already) and I loved it. When trying to find some info on it today I couldn't find anything of substance. The most information was on UrbanSpoon, but that merely had 9 votes and not much data.

[![Vinny's Cucina on Urbanspoon](http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/1675361/biglink.gif)](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/71/1675361/restaurant/Melbourne/Vinnys-Cucina-Ivanhoe)

So I'm posting this so there is more than zero data on the web about them :)

I was wandering down Ivanhoe strip looking for somewhere to eat with two gaming buddies of mine and we'd got to the end of the strip with no decisions having been made. So we went into Vinny's and asked for a table. The first sign we'd made a good choice was they told us they were sorry but they were fully booked but we could have a table on the front patio if we wanted. It was long enough ago that eating dinner on the front patio was still a good idea so we stayed.

The food is good Italian with lots of pasta and pizza, we ordered a range of them and were very very pleased with everything we ordered. We were pleased enough that I even ordered a desert that would typically not be on my list of desires and it blew me away (I usually don't order chocolate deserts, this one was awesome).

I'm not sure why I haven't made it back there yet. I probably will later this week (hence why I was looking for details online).

I'll probably post a better write up of it after that. Hopefully when it is still fresh in my mind.

PS: Hrm, it's been over a year has it? Oh well.
