Ok, I have to revise my ratings. Grill'd get a -0.5, they haven't changed anything but my outlook on their burgers has changed. Their filling are as fantastic as I used to think, they are very good but their is room for improvement. Also I feel there needs to be more room at the top of the scale to allow for perfect execution along with a broader and more experimental menu.




Urban Burger are also getting a move, but in the other direction, +0.5. I had their Blue and Bacon on the weekend, one of their beef burgers. Adding a good strong smelly cheese to a burger was sure to be a hit with me, so little surprise at the shift in rating. I do still think their buns are letting them down hugely, if they improved to a better bread they would easily equal or surpass Grill'd. <!-- more -->
