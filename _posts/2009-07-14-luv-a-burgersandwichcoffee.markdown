So I've been traveling to [Middlemount](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=middlemount+Queensland,+Australia&sll=-23.32208,147.348633&sspn=11.064171,24.697266&ie=UTF8&ll=-22.945748,148.74115&spn=1.388547,2.04071&t=h&z=9&iwloc=A) in central Queensland for work quite a bit recently, we've sold a system to help prevent some of their machines from crashing into each other.

So naturally I've been trying to get some decent food after I fly into [Emerald](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Emerald+Queensland,+Australia&sll=-23.397724,148.337402&sspn=2.767597,4.081421&ie=UTF8&ll=-23.32208,147.348633&spn=11.064171,24.697266&t=h&z=6&iwloc=A). I've found a decent little café called Luv a Coffee, in[ a shopping center](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=-23.528022,148.164278&t=h&sll=-22.81046,148.699231&sspn=1.319681,2.04895&ie=UTF8&ll=-23.528166,148.164411&spn=0.010801,0.015943&z=16) in Emerald. The first lunch I had there I ordered their beef burger. The burger was pretty good, many café's could learn a useful lesson or two from them, although they still suffer from the low quality bun syndrome.

Is it really that hard to buy quality buns?<!-- more -->

If there burger was all there was to this story I wouldn't be bothering to write it, despite the 8.5 the burger is going to get in my rating.

The real story is the club sandwich. While I was eating my burger I saw someone on an adjacent table eating one of the club sandwiches. Three slices of toast with chicken, tomato, lettuce, bacon, mayonnaise, avocado some some important ingredient that I'm forgetting. Cut into four triangles arranged on the plate using skewers to hold the pieces together.

The plate is finished off with a stack of shoe string fries covered in a great tasting red salt.

I know its a simple dish, but so is a good burger. Its just very well put together. I'm going to give the club sandwich a 9, but it doesn't get to go in the scale as its not a burger
