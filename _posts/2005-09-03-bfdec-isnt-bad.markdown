Broken Fatties.dec isn't all that bad, I pulled it out last night against the guys a LURG (LaTrobe University Roleplay Group) and it surprised me. First I played it against my pre-saviors White Weenie Legends block deck. It went something like 2-2 with both decks having reasonably average draws, no mana screw or flood for either deck. Then I played it in 3 4 player games. It dominated. Completely, in games 2 and 3 there was some significant gunning for my deck but it pulled through.




admittedly this testing in the 4 player games was sub par as the guy piloting my WWL deck was discarding Jitte as he couldn't remember by verbal description of what it does (proxies due to friend having borrowed them at nationals and not having given them back yet), this can be excused because he's only just coming back to the game after several years away. The next player played several different decks in the games, but they featured such things as Farewell to Arms and Teferi's Puzzle Box, so we could call his decks 'strictly casual' to be friendly. The fourth player was playing what I'd call 'good casual' decks, his deck that I like playing with most is a pile of CITP triggering creatures with a 5 colour base, so lots of invasion kicker creatures and such with 1 set of crystal shards




All in all though the deck played out very well, I might exchange the numbers of O-Naginatas and Loxodon Warhammers, but that might just be greedy, also wondering if the Wildfires are needed or not.
