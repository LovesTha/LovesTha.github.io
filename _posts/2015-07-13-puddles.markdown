As I mentioned in my [State of Gareth][1] post I'm trying to get a lot 
healthier currently, a major aspect of this is riding. Before we moved to 
Ringwood I was riding to work three of four days a week, while it was only 7 km 
twice a day it was feeling pretty good. 

The commute from Ringwood is closer to 30 km and while I'm close to being happy 
to do that distance quite regularly I'm not comfortable doing it fast enough to 
make it work for commuting. This means I need to get my cycling hit on the 
weekend, which is fine but when a weekend has weather like this one just gone 
it isn't all that pleasant. I went for a ride on Sunday afternoon and the rain 
was quiet significant.

Anyone who has done any amount of riding knows that most bike paths are built 
along rivers, streams and creeks. Everyone with a basic understanding of the 
physical world realises that rain causes them to flood. Yesterday's rain wasn't 
enough for them to flood, but they were quiet swollen and were filling the are 
I don't know the name for. In my experience most waterways in suburbia have two 
banks, the normal small ones that they keep well within for most of the year. 
Then they have a secondary set of banks that they fill when ever their is 
substantial rain fall. Not storm level rain fall, just typical "it's rained for 
3 days" weather that a healthy winter has several times. Does anyone know the 
name for that secondary bank?

So I was riding along the Mullum Mullum Creek Trail and was distracted by the joy 
of finally not having to do a detour when crossing Warrandyte Road and decided to 
use the underpass to cross Ringwood Street. I could see what looked like a 2m long 
puddle at the end of the underpass and headed in. I'm not crazy so I was doing it 
at a safe speed and discovered that it was more like 10m long and was about a foot 
deep.

Getting that wet that early in a ride isn't the best, but I was going to end up
completely saturated riding in the rain either way.

When I later went to join the Blind Creek Trail at High Street Road I decided it 
was worth capturing the following picture.

Thus I was on high alert for water conditions along the Blink Creek, I did have to 
use the traffic lights at Knox as that underpass was also under water.

Naturally the joy at not having to use a detour at Warrandyte Road meant there would
have to be another detour on the route. When I tried to use the Waldheim Road 
entrance to the Dandenong Creek path there was large signs and fences telling me the 
path was closed. Naturally there was zero information telling me about where else I 
could access the path from so I just wound my way through the back streets till I found
a way on.

Up till now I hadn't seen another cyclist crazy enough to go for a ride in the rain.
When I stopped to take this photo:

You really wouldn't want to fail to notice the water. There is a hair pin corner right 
about there, if you hit that water at speed you'll be swimming immediately. What was 
crazy though was the mountain bike cyclist you suddenly appeared from the centre of 
that photo. I think he rode between the tree and the fence. With a polite nod he passed 
me wondering why this bozo was taking a photo of a swollen river.

The final incident of note on the ride was that as I was crossing Croydon - Scoresby 
Road while I was stranded in the middle of the road waiting for a chance to turn right a
car travelling the other way didn't notice that the car in front of them was trying to 
turn right and slammed into it. This delayed my right turn as the cars banked up while 
they tried to sort out what they were all doing.
