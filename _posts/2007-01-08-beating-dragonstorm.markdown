I've been playing a Goblins Storm deck in standard for a little while now, and I love it. The number of decks that just fold to Blood Moon is quite scary. The biggest problem is that Dragonstorm isn't disrupted by Blood Moon and is quick enough to kill before Goblins does (combo should beat aggro), and I can't think of anything that is likely to help Mono Red beat Dragonstorm.

In fact the only deck type I can think of that has a consistent method of disrupting it is discard.  Discard seams to be the only proactive way to destroy the combo deck and all the reactive ways are defeated by Gigadrowse.

So this means that the perfect dragon killer deck must be black. And with Castigate being so desirable I feel that BW is the best option.

So the deck this far:
4x Castigate
4x Persecute
4x Blackmail (I like the idea of DS suspending 2 Loti and playing a land on turn1 having to show me nearly all of their hand)<!-- more -->

There are plenty of creatures around in Standard at the moment:
2x Wrath of God (not running many white sources)
4x Damnation
4x Mortify

Some resilient threats:
2x Skeletal Vampire
2x Sengir Nosferatu

Some utility creatures:
4x Ravenous Rats
2x Withered Wretch

And a little bit of acceleration/colour fixing:
4x Orzhov Signet

Leaving room for 24 land,  4 Flagstones, 4 Godless Shrines, 2 Basilica, 2 Caves, 10 swamp, 2 plains.

Sideboard:
4x Jester's Cap (can't go too far against Dragon Storm)
2x Withered Wretch (I'm sure this is good against re-animator)
4x Condemn (need more removal for creatures)
2x Wrath of God
3x Darkblast

What do people think of this deck?
