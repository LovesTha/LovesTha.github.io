Long time no posts my friends. I checked and my last post was shortly before I proposed to my now wife. That was my only post while dating and I managed to skip the engaged phase completely.

Not really a surprise considering how busy the whole process of getting married is :)

So if anyone is wondering why the return to blogging? I heard about Jekyll and decided it was something to play with. 

I might just get back to blogging a bit more though, it is something I like to do. It helps me collect my thoughts on things.
