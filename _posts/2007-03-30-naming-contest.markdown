Here's your chance to win some loot. Up for grabs is a Foil Textless Wrath of God (still in original plastic) or a 3 month subscription to deviantART. All you have to do is come up with a name for a project that Alex and I are undertaking: a web comic based around magic players.

To enter just send a (that is a single) email to gareth@cerberos.id.au with the subject: Name A Comic. In that email you may submit your best 2 title ideas.

Entries will close at midnight Friday the 13th of April (AEST). Then Alex and I will determine the best few entries and put up a poll to let people judge the best entry. The title that wins that poll will receive their choice of the two prizes, with the WoG being posted to them at my expense. I won't guarantee that we will use the winning name, but it will inspire us.
