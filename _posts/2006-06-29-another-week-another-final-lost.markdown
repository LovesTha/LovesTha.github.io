So that's two weeks running at Card Heaven where I've lost the final of a draft in 3 games. This time it was to the double [Goblin Spelunkers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/gathererlookup.asp?set=RavnicaCityofGuilds&name=goblin_spelunkers) opening hand game three, naturally he'd led up to the Spelunkers with a [Plagued Rusalka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/gathererlookup.asp?set=Guildpact&name=plagued_rusalka), leaving my only option for removing the mountain walkers, [Gelectrode](http://gatherer.wizards.com/gathererlookup.asp?name=gelectrode&x=0&y=0), stranded in hand for too many turns.

Naturally there was only 2 Shock Lands in the pool, so I had to be content with a [Windreaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/gathererlookup.asp?name=windreaver&x=0&y=0).

Some time soon I'm going to manage to actually go 3-0, I know it!
