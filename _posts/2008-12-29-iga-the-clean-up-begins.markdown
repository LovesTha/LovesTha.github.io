Not sure how we got onto it but a friend I was chatting with yesterday mentioned that the IGAs (Independent Grocers Association) were increasing the requirements and standards on keeping membership with them. So what do I see today when I walk into what I always think of as the worst IGA ever?

Yes the random Chinese ladies who work the store are going around furiously cleaning every surface they can get to. I hope this isn't a once off cleaning effort.

PS: Yes, long time no post. Hoping to get back into the rhythm now.
