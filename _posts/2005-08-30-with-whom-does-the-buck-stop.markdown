Why do tournament results take so long to appear on the DCI's reports? Only 2 of the events that I competed in at Nationals have shown up yet. One being a PTQ and the other being one of the sealed side events, Saturdays lucky dip if my memory of who played in what is right.




Either DCI reporter is such a bad application to use that it is so horrendous to use that people avoid it as much as possible or everyone who manages to become a local tournament organiser is a very lazy person. I suspect that both of the above are at least slightly true.




The most interaction a TO should have with DCI reporter after they are happy with the result (which should be ~10 seconds after the end of the tournament in 99% of all tournaments run) is possibly hitting 'Submit', or even better they should be asked to submit by the program as soon as an internet connection is found.




I can understand the reluctance of the DCI to 'encourage' TOs to submit any quicker than they already do as it might discourage them from running more tournaments. Which is a Bad ThingTM. What I can't understand is why so many TOs don't report things quicker to make us players more happy.
