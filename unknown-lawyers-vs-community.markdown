# The Situation

So recently a thing happened. Predictably the community reacted badly, but
I think that was sort of predictable. I'm unsure how avoidable it was, and
as I'm not a lawyer I'm not sure how valuable my comentary will be. But I
feel I need to at least write about it. The sanity in publishing it is much
easier to question, but that is a question for a later day.

The cause of the thing was that a social media storm errupted about a 
convicted feloon making top 8 of a GP. Some tweeter I've never heard of, I 
don't follow the professional Magic circuit that closely, was tweeting 
links to articles about his criminal past and the Internet was much a 
twitter with outrage.

The felon then posted to Redit a brief summary of his life since the 
conviction, he wasn't trying to diminish what he'd done, just show that it 
wasn't the start of a trend in his behaviour. It showed that he was working
at being both a good human and to bettering of society.

He didn't go into details about the crime it self, his early plea bargain
coupled with the nature of his crime to give him a short immediate 
custodial sentence with a much more significant one delayed. He has passed
his bar entrance exam recently and when applying to become a member of the
bar he only had to declare two minor traffic offences in adition to the 
significant crime that caused this kerfufle. While the bar didn't admit him
yet, they didn't knock him back they just deffered their decision till they
have had more time to think about the situation.

Please don't take the above to indicate that I think his crime was not 
really a crime. Not all crimes are equal though, (sane) laws agree and 
allow judges significant leeway in the punishments they can hand out for 
the same basic crime. Murder can get from life all the way down to a minor
slap on the wrist (comparitavely). Even in our small corner of the world
cheaters in Magic get very different punishments, while they all get 
disquallified from the tournament some receive a sternly worded warning
letter and others receiving lengthy suspensions from the game.

Following the twitter storm there was a small but vocal group of people 
hassling WotC for a response about allowing this player to play in large
events. As his crime was violent towards a woman there were a lot of 
people clammering for his scalp, and they were poking a hot topic right
now. We as a community are trying pretty hard to make Magic a more 
welcoming community for everyone. Even those people who aren't young
white men. Apparently some of those people have money and deserve to be
able to spend that money on enjoying themselves.

This all lead to the most recent update to the official list of 
suspended players including this criminal. He was given what is 
effectively a life ban. A friend of his forwarded to 

# Why Everyone Is Doing What They Are Doing


- suspensions are done privately but with due process and appeals processes, they at least talk to them before passing judgement.
